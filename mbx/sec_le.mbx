  <title>Logical equivalences</title>
  <p>
    Some logical statements are <q>the same.</q> For example, in the last
    section, we discussed the fact that a conditional
    and its contrapositive have the same logical content. Wouldn't
    we be justified in writing something like the following?
    <me>
      A \implies B \; = \; {\lnot}B \implies {\lnot}A
    </me>
  </p>

  <p>
    Well, one pretty serious objection to doing that is that the
    equals sign (<m>=</m>) has already got a job; it is used to indicate that
    two numerical quantities are the same. What we're doing here is
    really sort of a different thing! Nevertheless, there is a concept
    of <q>sameness</q> between certain compound statements, and we need a
    symbolic way of expressing it. There are two notations in common
    use. The notation that seems to be preferred by logicians is the
    biconditional (<m>\iff</m>). The notation we'll use
    in the rest of this book is an equals sign with a bit of extra decoration
    on it (<m>\cong</m>).
  </p>

  <p>
    Thus we can can either write
    <me>
      (A \implies B) \; \iff \; ({\lnot}B \implies {\lnot}A)
    </me>
    or
    <me>
      A \implies B \; \cong \; {\lnot}B \implies {\lnot}A.
    </me>
  </p>

  <p>
    I like the latter, but use whichever form you like <mdash /> no one
    will have any problem understanding either.
  </p>

  <p>
    The formal definition of <index><main>logical equivalence</main></index><em>logical equivalence</em>,
    which is what we've
    been describing, is this: two compound sentences are logically equivalent
    if in a truth table (that contains all possible combinations of the
    truth values of the predicate variables in its rows) the truth values
    of the two sentences are equal in every row.
  </p>
  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider the two compound sentences <m>A \lor B</m> and <m>A \lor ({\lnot}A \land B)</m>.
        There are a total of 2 predicate variables between them, so a truth table
        with 4 rows will suffice. Fill out the missing entries in the truth
        table and determine whether the statements are equivalent.

    One could, in principle, verify all logical equivalences by filling out
    truth tables. Indeed, in the exercises for this section we will ask you
    to develop a certain facility at this task. While this activity can
    be somewhat fun, and many of my students want the filling-out of truth
    tables to
    be a significant portion of their midterm exam, you will probably eventually
    come to find it somewhat tedious. A slightly more mature approach to logical
    equivalences is this: use a set of basic equivalences <mdash /> which themselves
    may be verified via truth tables <mdash /> as the basic <em>rules</em> or
    <index><main>laws of logical equivalence</main></index><em>laws</em>
    of logical equivalence, and develop a strategy for converting one
    sentence into another using these rules. This process will feel very
    familiar, it is like <q>doing</q> algebra, but the rules one is allowed
    to use are subtly different.
  </p>

  <p>
    First we have the <index><main>commutative law</main></index><em>commutative laws</em>,
    one each for conjunction
    and disjunction. It's worth noting that there <em>isn't</em> a commutative
    law for implication.
  </p>

  <p>
    The commutative property of conjunction says that <m>A \land B \cong B \land A</m>.
    This is quite an apparent statement from the perspective of linguistics.
    Surely it's the same thing to say <q>the weather is cold and snowy</q> as it is to
    say <q>the weather is snowy and cold.</q>
    This commutative property is also clear
    from the perspective of digital logic circuits.

  <p>
    The commutative property of disjunctions is equally transparent from
    the perspective of a circuit diagram.

  <p>
    The <index><main>associative law</main></index><em>associative laws</em> also have something to do with what order operations
    are done. One could think of the difference in the following terms:
    Commutative properties
    involve spatial or physical order and the associative properties involve
    temporal order. The associative law of addition could be used to say we'll
    get the same result if we add 2 and 3 first, then add 4, or if we add 2 to the
    sum of 3 and 4 (i.e. that <m>(2+3)+4</m> is the same as <m>2+(3+4)</m>.) Note that
    physically, the numbers are in the same order (2 then 3 then 4) in both
    expressions but that the parentheses indicate a precedence in <em>when</em> the
    plus signs are evaluated.
  </p>

  <p>
    The associative law of conjunction states that <m>A \land (B \land C) \cong
    (A \land B) \land C</m>. In visual terms, this means the following two
    circuit diagrams are equivalent.

    The associative law of disjunction states that <m>A \lor (B \lor C) \cong
    (A \lor B) \lor C</m>. Visually, this looks like:

  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        In a situation where <em>both</em> associativity and commutativity pertain
        the symbols involved can appear in any order and with any reasonable
        parenthesization. In how many different ways can the sum <m>2+3+4</m>
        be expressed? Only consider expression that are fully parenthesized.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </exercise>
  <p>
    The next type of basic logical equivalences we'll consider are the
    so-called <index><main>distributive law</main></index><em>distributive laws</em>.
    Distributive laws involve the
    interaction of two operations, when we distribute multiplication
    over a sum, we effectively replace one instance of an operand <em>and the associated operator</em>, with two instances, as is illustrated
    below.
  </p>
  <image source="images/3773292f0c8831b3ef36257060e3ec94c0790646.png"/>
  \ifx\SetFigFont\undefined\gdef\SetFigFont#1#2#3#4#5{

  <image source="images/0e2010e3496aeb42cfeb9c504730cb00403fb0aa.png"/>
  <p>
    The logical operators <m>\land</m> and <m>\lor</m> each distribute over the other.
    Thus we have the distributive law of conjunction over disjunction, which
    is expressed in the equivalence
    <m>A \land (B \lor C) \cong (A \land B) \lor (A \land C)</m>
    and in the following digital logic circuit diagram.

  <p>
    We also have the distributive law of disjunction over conjunction
    which is given by the equivalence
    <m>A \lor (B \land C) \cong (A \lor B) \land (A \lor C)</m> and in the
    circuit diagram:

    Traditionally, the laws we've just stated would be called
    <em>left</em>-distributive laws and we would also need to state
    that there are <em>right</em>-distributive laws that apply. Since,
    in the current setting, we have already said that the commutative
    law is valid, this isn't really necessary.
  </p>
  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        State the right-hand versions of the distributive laws.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </exercise>
  <p>
    The next set of laws we'll consider come from trying to
    figure out what the distribution of a minus sign over a sum
    (<m>-(x+y) = -x + -y</m>)
    should correspond to in Boolean algebra. At first blush one
    might assume the analogous thing in Boolean algebra would be
    something like <m>{\lnot}(A \land B) \cong {\lnot}A \land {\lnot}B</m>,
    but we can easily dismiss this by looking at a truth table.

    What actually works is a set of rules known as
    <index><main>DeMorgan's laws</main></index>DeMorgan's laws, which
    basically say that you distribute the negative sign but
    you also must change the operator. As logical equivalences,
    DeMorgan's laws are
    <me>
      {\lnot}(A \land B) \; \cong \; {\lnot}A \lor {\lnot}B
    </me>
    and
    <me>
      {\lnot}(A \lor B) \; \cong \; {\lnot}A \land {\lnot}B.
    </me>
  </p>

  <p>
    In ordinary arithmetic there are two notions of <q>inverse.</q> The
    <em>negative</em> of a number is known as its additive inverse and
    the <em>reciprocal</em> of a number is its multiplicative inverse.
    These notions lead to a couple of equations,
    <me>
      x + -x = 0
    </me>
    and
    <me>
      x \cdot \frac{1}{x} = 1.
    </me>
  </p>

  <p>
    Boolean algebra only has one <q>inverse</q> concept, the denial
    of a predicate (i.e. logical negation), but the equations above have analogues, as do
    the symbols <m>0</m> and <m>1</m> that appear in them. First, consider
    the Boolean expression <m>A \lor {\lnot}A</m>. This is the logical <em>or</em>
    of a statement and its exact opposite; when one is true the other is
    false and vice versa. But, the disjunction <m>A \lor {\lnot}A</m>, is
    always true! We use the symbol <m>t</m> (which stands for
    <index><main>tautology</main></index><em>tautology</em>)
    to represent a compound sentence whose truth value is always true.
    A tautology (<m>t</m>) is to Boolean algebra something like a zero (<m>0</m>)
    is to arithmetic. Similar thinking about the Boolean expression
    <m>A \land {\lnot}A</m> leads to the definition of the symbol <m>c</m> (which
    stands for <index><main>contradiction</main></index><em>contradiction</em>) to
    represent a sentence that is always
    false. The rules we have been discussing are known as
    <index><main>complementarity laws</main></index><em>complementarity laws</em>:
    <me>
      A \lor {\lnot}A \; \cong \; t \mbox{ and } 
      A \land {\lnot}A \; \cong \; c
    </me>
  </p>

  <p>
    Now that we have the special logical sentences represented by <m>t</m> and <m>c</m>
    we can present the so-called <index><main>identity laws</main></index><em>identity laws</em>,
    <m>A \land t \cong A</m> and
    <m>A \lor c \cong A</m>. If you <q>and</q> a statement with something that is always
    true, this new compound has the exact same truth values as the original.
    If you <q>or</q> a statement with something that is always false, the new compound
    statement is also unchanged from the original. Thus performing a
    conjunction with a tautology has no effect <mdash /> sort of like multiplying by 1.
    Performing a disjunction with a contradiction also has no effect <mdash /> this is
    somewhat akin to adding 0.
  </p>

  <p>
    The number 0 has a special property: <m>0 \cdot x = 0</m> is an equation that
    holds no matter what <m>x</m> is. This is known as a domination property. Note
    that there isn't a dominance rule that involves 1.
    On the Boolean side,
    <em>both</em> the symbols <m>t</m> and <m>c</m> have related domination rules.
    <me>
      A \lor t \cong t \mbox{ and }  
      A \land c \cong c
    </me>
  </p>

  <p>
    In mathematics the word <index><main>idempotent</main></index><em>idempotent</em> is used to describe situations where
    a power of a thing may be equal to that thing. For example, because <m>(-1)^3 = -1</m>, we say that <m>-1</m> is an idempotent. Both of the Boolean operations
    have idempotence relations that just always work (regardless of the operand).
    In ordinary algebra idempotents are very rare (<m>0</m>, <m>1</m> and <m>-1</m> are the only
    ones that come to mind), but in Boolean algebra <em>every</em> statement
    is equivalent to its square <mdash /> where the square of <m>A</m> can be interpreted
    either as <m>A \land A</m> or as <m>A \lor A</m>.
    <me>
      A \lor A \cong A \mbox{ and } 
      A \land A \cong A
    </me>
  </p>

  <p>
    There are a couple of properties of the logical negation operator
    that should be stated, though probably they seem self-evident.
    If you form the denial of a denial, you come back to the
    same thing as the original; also the symbols <m>c</m> and <m>t</m> are negations
    of one another.
    <me>
      \lnot({\lnot}A) \cong A \mbox{ and } 
      {\lnot}t  \cong c
    </me>
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally, we should mention a really strange property, called
    <index><main>absorption</main></index><em>absorption</em>,
    which states that the expressions <m>A \land (A \lor B)</m> and <m>A \lor (A \land B)</m>
    don't actually have anything to do with <m>B</m> at all! Both of the preceding
    statements are equivalent to <m>A</m>.
    <me>
      A \land (A \lor B) \cong A \mbox{ and } 
      A \lor (A \land B) \cong A
    </me>

        There are 3 operations used in basic algebra (addition, 
        multiplication and exponentiation) and thus
        there are potentially 6 different distributive laws.  State
        all 6 <q>laws</q> and determine which 2 are actually valid.
        (As an example, the distributive law of addition over multiplication
        would look like <m>x + (y \cdot z) = (x + y) \cdot (x + z)</m>, this isn't 
        one of the true ones.) 



        \hint{


        These <q>laws</q> should probably be layed-out in a big 3 by 3 table. Such a table would of course have 9 cells, but we won't be using the cells on the diagonal because they would involve an operation distributing over itself. (That can't happen, can it?)
        I'm going to put a few of the entries in, and you do the rest.

        \hint{
        Here's the pair that shows the negation of an AND is the same as the OR of the same inputs negated.

    Find the negation of each of the following and simplify as much as possible.

          <m>(A \lor B) \; \implies \; (A \land B)</m>
        </p></li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    \hint{Neither of these is particularly amenable to simplification. Nor, perhaps, is it readily
    apparent what <q>simplify</q> means in this context! My interpretation is that we should look
    for a logically equivalent expression using the fewest number of operators and if possible
    <em>not</em> using the more complicated operators (<m>\implies</m> and <m>\iff</m>).  However, if we try 
    to rewrite the first statement's negation using only <m>\land</m>, <m>\lor</m> and <m>\lnot</m> we get things
    that look a lot more complicated than <m>(A \lor B) \; \iff \; {\lnot}C</m> <mdash /> the quick way to negate a 
    biconditional is simply to negate one of its parts.

    The second statement's negation turns out to be the same thing as exclusive or, so a particularly
    simple response would be to write <m>A \oplus B</m> although that feels a bit like cheating, so
    maybe we should answer with <m>(A \lor B) \land {\lnot}(A \land B)</m> <mdash /> but that answer is what we
    would get by simply applying the rule for negating a conditional and doing no further simplification.

    Because a conditional sentence is equivalent to a certain disjunction, and 
    because DeMorgan's law tells us that the negation of a disjunction is a conjunction,
    it follows that the negation of a conditional is a conjunction.  Find denials (the negation
    of a sentence is often called its <q>denial</q>) for each of the following conditionals.

    The so-called <q>ethic of reciprocity</q> is an idea that has come 
    up in many of the world's religions and philosophies.  
    Below are statements of the ethic
    from several sources.  Discuss their logical meanings and determine which (if 
    any) are logically equivalent.

          <q>One should not behave towards others in a way which is disagreeable to oneself.</q> Mencius Vii.A.4 (Hinduism)

          <q>None of you [truly] believes until he wishes for his brother what he wishes for himself.</q> Number 13 of Imam <q>Al-Nawawi's Forty Hadiths.</q> (Islam)
        </p></li>

      <li><p>
          <q>And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.</q> Luke 6:31, King James Version. (Christianity)
        </p></li>

      <li><p>
          <q>What is hateful to you, do not to your fellow man. This is the law: all the rest is commentary.</q> Talmud, Shabbat 31a. (Judaism)
        </p></li>

          <q>What you would avoid suffering yourself, seek not to impose on others.</q> (the Greek philosopher Epictetus <mdash /> first century A.D.)

      <li><p>
          <q>Do not do unto others as you expect they should do unto you. Their tastes may not be the same.</q> (the Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw <mdash /> 20th century A.D.)
        </p></li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    \hint{
    The ones from Wicca and George Bernard Shaw are just there for laughs.

    For the remainder, you may want to contrast how restrictive they seem. For example the Christian version is (in my opinion) a lot stronger than the one from the Talmud <mdash /> <q>treat others as you would want to be treated</q> restricts your actions both in terms of what you would like done to you and in terms of what you wouldn't like done to you; <q>Don't treat your fellows in a way that would be hateful to you.</q> is leaving you a lot more freedom of action, since it only prohibits you from doing those things you wouldn't want done to yourself to others. The Hindus, Epictetus and the Jews (and the Wiccans for that matter) seem to be expressing roughly the same sentiment <mdash /> and promoting an ethic that is rather more easy for humans to conform to!

    From a logical perspective it might be nice to define open sentences:
    <me>
      W(x,y) \; = \; \mbox{``x would want y done to him.''}
    </me>
    <me>
      N(x,y)  \; = \; \mbox{``x would not want y done to him.''}
    </me>
    <me>
      D(x,y)  \; = \; \mbox{``do y to x.''}
    </me>
    <me>
      DD(x,y)  \; = \; \mbox{``don't do y to x.''}
    </me>
    In which case, the aphorism from Luke would be
    <me>
      (W(you, y) \implies  D(others, y)) \land (N(you, y) \implies DD(others, y))
    </me>

        Bonaparte says <q>I am a knight and Wellington is a knave.</q>

        Wellington says <q>I would tell you that B is a knight.</q>

        <em>Claim:</em> Bonaparte is a knight and Wellington is a knave.

        <proof>
          <p>
            Either Wellington is a knave or Wellington is a knight.
          </p>

          <p>
            If Wellington is a knight it follows that Bonaparte is a knight.
          </p>

          <p>
            If Bonaparte is a knight then Wellington is a knave.
          </p>

          <p>
            So, if Wellington is a knight then Wellington is a knave (which is impossible!)
          </p>

          <p>
            Thus, Wellington is a knave.
          </p>

          <p>
            Since Wellington is a knave, his statement <q>I would tell you that Bonaparte is a knight</q> is false.
          </p>

          <p>
            So Wellington would in fact tell us that Bonaparte is a knave.
          </p>

          <p>
            Since Wellington is a knave we conclude that Bonaparte is a knight.
          </p>

          <p>
            Thus Bonaparte is a knight and Wellington is a knave (as claimed).
          </p>
        </proof>

        \hint{
        Here's the second one:

        <proof>
          <p>
            Either Wellington is a knave or Wellington is a knight.

          <p>
            \text{ It's either one thing or the other! }

          <p>
            If Wellington is a knight it follows that Bonaparte is a knight.
          </p>

          <p>
            \text{ That's what he said he would tell us and if he's a knight we can trust him. }
          </p>

          <p>
            If Bonaparte is a knight then Wellington is a knave.
          </p>

          <p>
            \text{ True, because that is one of the things Bonaparte states. }
          </p>

          <p>
            So, if Wellington is a knight then Wellington is a knave (which is impossible!)
          </p>

          <p>
            \text{ This is just summing up what was deduced above. }
          </p>

          <p>
            Thus, Wellington is a knave.
          </p>

          <p>
            \text{ Because the other possibility leads to something <em>im</em>possible. }
          </p>

          <p>
            Since Wellington is a knave, his statement <q>I would tell you that Bonaparte is a knight</q> is false.
          </p>

          <p>
            \text{ Knave's statements are always false! }
          </p>

          <p>
            So Wellington would in fact tell us that Bonaparte is a knave.
          </p>

          <p>
            \text{ He was lying when he said he would tell us B is a knight. }
          </p>

          <p>
            Since Wellington is a knave we conclude that Bonaparte is a knight.
          </p>

          <p>
            \text{ Wait, now I'm confused<ellipsis /> can you do this part? }
          </p>

          <p>
            Thus Bonaparte is a knight and Wellington is a knave (as claimed).
