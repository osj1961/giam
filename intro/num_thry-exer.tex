\begin{enumerate}

\item An integer $n$ is \index{doubly-even} \emph{doubly-even} 
if it is even, and the integer $m$ guaranteed to exist because 
$n$ is even is itself even.  Is 0 doubly-even?  What are the 
first 3 positive, doubly-even integers?

\wbvfill

\hint{Answers: yes, 0,4 and 8.}

\item Dividing an integer by two has an interesting interpretation
when using binary notation: simply shift the digits to the right.
Thus, $22 = 10110_2$ when divided by two gives $1011_2$ which is
$8+2+1=11$.  How can you recognize a doubly-even integer from
its binary representation?

\wbvfill

\hint{Even numbers have a zero in their units place.  What digit must also be zero in a doubly-even number's binary representation?}

\item The \index{octal representation} \emph{octal} representation 
of an integer uses powers of 8 in place notation.  The digits of an 
octal number run from 0 to 7, one never sees 8's or 9's.  How would 
you represent 8 and 9 as octal numbers?  What octal number comes 
immediately after $777_8$?  What (decimal) number is $777_8$?

\wbvfill

\workbookpagebreak

\hint{Eight is $10_8$, nine is $11_8$.  The point of asking questions about $777$, is that (in octal) $7$ is the digit that is analogous to $9$ in base-$10$.  Thus $777_8$ is something like $999_{10}$ in that the number following both of them is written $1000$ (although $1000_8$ and $1000_{10}$ are certainly not equal!)}

\hintspagebreak

\item One method of converting from decimal to some other base is
called \index{repeated division algorithm} \emph{repeated division}.  
One divides the number by the base
and records the remainder -- one then divides the quotient obtained
by the base and records the remainder.  Continue dividing the 
successive quotients by the base until the quotient is smaller than
the base.  Convert 3267 to base-7 using repeated division.  Check 
your answer by using the meaning of base-7 place notation.  (For
example $54321_7$ means $5\cdot7^4 + 4\cdot7^3 + 3 \cdot7^2 +
2\cdot7^1 + 1\cdot7^0$.)

\wbvfill

\hint{It is helpful to write something of the form $n = qd+r$ at each stage.  The first two stages should look like

\[ 3267 \; = \; 466 \cdot 7 + 5 \]

\[ 466 \; = \; 66 \cdot 7 + 4 \]

you do the rest\ldots
}

\item State a theorem about the octal representation of even numbers.

\wbvfill

\hint{One possibility is to mimic the result for base-10 that an even number always ends in 0,2,4,6 or 8.}

\item In hexadecimal (base-16) notation one needs 16 ``digits,'' the
  ordinary digits are used for 0 through 9, and the letters A through
  F are used to give single symbols for 10 through 15.  The first  32
  natural number in hexadecimal are:
  1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,\newline 17,18,19,1A,
  1B,1C,1D,1E,1F,20. 

  Write the next 10 hexadecimal numbers after $AB$.

  Write the next 10 hexadecimal numbers after $FA$.

\hint{As a check, the tenth number after AB is B5.\newline
The tenth hexadecimal number after FA is 104.}

\item For conversion between the three bases used most often in 
Computer Science we can take binary as the ``standard'' base and 
convert using a table look-up.  Each octal digit will correspond 
to a binary triple, and each hexadecimal digit will correspond to 
a 4-tuple of binary numbers.  Complete the following tables.  
(As a check, the 4-tuple next to $A$ in the table for
hexadecimal should be 1010 -- which is nice since $A$ 
is really 10 so if you read that as ``ten-ten'' it is a good 
aid to memory.)
