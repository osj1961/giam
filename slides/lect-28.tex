\section{intro}

\begin{frame}{strong induction}
\begin{itemize}
\item Strong induction goes by many names: \pause
\begin{itemize}
\item Strong induction. \pause
\item Complete induction. \pause
\item Course of values induction. \pause
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{the principle of complete induction}
\begin{itemize}
\item $ \displaystyle \forall k (P_0 \land P_1 \land \ldots \land  P_{k-1}) \implies P_k.$
\item PMI and PCI are logically equivalent. \pause
\item Nevertheless, there are times when PCI is much more convenient. \pause
\item You get to use the truth of {\em all} the statements prior to $P_n$ to prove it. \pause
\item That's what makes it ``strong'' -- the hypotheses are much stronger!
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{outline}

\rule{0pt}{16pt}{\bf \large Theorem} $ \displaystyle \forall n \in \Naturals, \; P_n $
\medskip

\rule{0pt}{20pt} {\em Proof:} (By complete induction)

\noindent {\bf Basis:}

\begin{center}
$\vdots$ \rule{36pt}{0pt} \begin{minipage}[c]{2.3 in} (Technically, a PCI %
proof doesn't require a basis.   We recommend that you show that $P_0$ %
is true anyway.) \end{minipage}
\end{center}

\noindent {\bf Inductive step:}

\begin{center}
$\vdots$ \rule{36pt}{0pt} \begin{minipage}[c]{2.3 in} (Here we must show that $\forall k,  \left( \bigwedge_{i=0}^{k-1} P_i \right) \implies P_{k}$ is true.) \end{minipage}
\end{center}

\rule{0pt}{0pt} \hspace{\fill} Q.E.D. \rule[-10pt]{0pt}{16pt}
\end{minipage} \rule{16pt}{0pt} \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{an issue}
\begin{itemize}
\item When $n=0$ in a PCI proof the inductive step looks like this: \pause
\item (The conjunction of an empty set of statements) \rule{1pt}{0pt} $\implies \; P_0$. \pause
\item The conjunction of {\em no} statements should be equivalent to the identity for conjunction. \pause
\item So if you do the inductive step in a strong induction argument correctly it should include the case where $P_0$ is implied by a tautology.\pause
\item This is really the base case! \pause
\item It's so easy to overlook this that I recommend doing a seperate base case, even though technically it isn't necessary.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{equivalent?}
\begin{itemize}
\item If a statement can be proved by ordinary induction, then it can certainly be proved by strong induction. \pause
\item In the strong induction version you know that all the statements from $P_0$ to $P_{n-1}$ are true,\pause \newline
 so in particular you know that $P_{n-1}$ is true \pause \newline
so you can just use the ordinary induction argument from there. \pause
\item To show the other implication we need to create a new statement family that's related to the $P$'s: \pause
\[ Q_k \; = \; \forall i \in \{0, \ldots k\}, \; P_i \; \mbox{is true.} \] \pause
\item Proving $Q_{k-1} \implies Q_k$ is really the same thing as the strong induction argument, but the $Q$ statement family can be proved using ordinary induction!
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{examples}

\begin{frame}{The fundamental theorem of arithmetic}
\begin{itemize}
\item Many areas of mathematics have something called the ``fundamental theorem.'' \pause
\item The fundamental theorem of calculus is
\[ \int_a^b f(x) \dx \; = \; F(b) - F(a), \; \mbox{where} \; F(x) \; \mbox{is an antiderivative of} \; f(x).\] \pause
\item The fundamental theorem of algebra is that every polynomial with real coeffiecients can be factored into a product of linear and irreducible quadratic terms. \pause
\item The fundamental theorem of arithmetic is that every positive integer has a unique representation as a product of prime powers. 

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{comments}
\begin{itemize}
\item Strong induction is necessary in proving the fundamental theorem of arithmetic because the prime factorization of $k$ and $k-1$ have nothing to do with one another! \pause
\item To get started on proving the fundamental theorem of arithmetic we first prove a lemma: \pause
\end{itemize}

\begin{lem*}
For every natural number $n$, if $n>1$, then $n$ has a prime factor.
\end{lem*}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{proof}
\begin{proof} (By strong induction)
Consider an arbitrary natural number $n>1$.  If $n$ is prime then $n$ clearly
has a prime factor (itself), so suppose that $n$ is not prime.  By 
definition, a composite
natural number can be factored, so $n=a \cdot b$ for some pair of natural
numbers $a$ and $b$ which are both greater than 1.  Since $a$ and $b$ are  
factors of $n$ both greater than 1, it follows that $a < n$ (it is also 
true that $b < n$ but we don't need that \ldots).  The inductive hypothesis
can now be applied to deduce that $a$ has a prime factor $p$.  Since
$p \divides a$ and $a \divides n$, by transitivity $p \divides n$.  Thus
$n$ has a prime factor.
\end{proof}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{recurrences}
\begin{itemize}
\item Most people have heard of the Fibonacci numbers, which are defined recursively by 
\[ F_{n} \; = \; F_{n-1} \, + \, F_{n-2}. \] \pause
\item There are {\em many} other sequences of numbers that are also defined recursively. \pause
\item When proving something about such a sequence it will be handy to know that that something is true for all the earlier values used in the recurrence! \pause 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{a formula}
\begin{itemize}
\item This example has been carefully cooked up so that the numbers work out nicely.\pause
\item A sequence is defined recursively by the formula
\[ X_n \; = \; X_{n-1} \, + \, 2X_{n-2}. \] \pause
\item ``The next number is the sum of the previous and twice the one before that.''
\item The initial values $X_0 = 2$ and $X_1 = 1$ are also given to get things started. \pause
\item From there we can use the recursion to find $X_2 = 5$, $X_3 = 7$, $X_4 = 17$, {\em et cetera}. \pause
\item It turns out that there is a relatively easy formula for this sequence: \pause
\[ X_n \; = \; 2^n \, + \, (-1)^n. \]

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{the result}
\begin{thm*}
\[ \forall n \in \Naturals, \; n \geq 2 \; \implies \; X_n  \; = \; 2^n \, + \, (-1)^n. \]
\end{thm*}
\pause
\begin{itemize}
\item Let's prove that using PCI. \pause
\item Notice that issue about base cases in a PCI proof is present.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{proof}
\begin{itemize}
\item Notice that when $n=2$ the recursion for $X_n$ refers to values that are not covered by the theorem. \pause
\item We note that $X_0 = 2$ and that is also equal to $2^0+(-1)^0$.  Additionally, note that $X_1 = 1$ and that is also equal to $2^1 + (-1)^1$. \pause
\item Suppose $k \geq 3$ is an integer such that for all $j<k$ we have $X_j = 2^j+(-1)^j$. \pause
\item In particular we need that $X_{k-1} = 2^{k-1}+(-1)^{k-1}$ and $X_{k-2} = 2^{k-2}+(-1)^{k-2}$. \pause
\item Then, 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{proof continued}
\begin{align*}
X_k \; &= \; X_{k-1} \, + \, 2 X_{k-2} & & \mbox{the given recurrence} \\
       &= \; (2^{k-1}\,+\,(-1)^{k-1}) \; + \; 2(2^{k-2}\,+\,(-1)^{k-2}) & & \mbox{by the inductive hypothesis}\\
       &= \; (2^{k-1}\,+\,2(2^{k-2})) \; + \; ((-1)^{k-1}\,+\,2(-1)^{k-2}) & & \mbox{algebra}\\
       &= \; (2^{k-1}\,+\,2^{k-1}) \; + \; (-1)^{k-2}((-1)^1\,+\,2) & & \mbox{more algebra}\\
       &= \; (2^{k}) \; + \; (-1)^{k-2}(1) & & \mbox{more more algebra}\\
       &= \; (2^{k}) \; + \; (-1)^{k-2}(-1)^2 & & \mbox{more more more algebra}\\
       &= \; (2^{k}) \; + \; (-1)^{k} & & \mbox{as desired}\\
\end{align*}

\hfill {\em Q.E.D.}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{usps}
\begin{itemize}
\item A postage stamp problem involves showing that given two types of stamps we can use them to achieve any amount of postage. \pause
\item There will be ``holes'' early on -- postages that can't be achieved exactly. \pause
\item But after some a finite number of initial misses, every postage can be achieved. \pause
\item For instance consider the postages that can be created using $3$\textcent\rule{1pt}{0pt} and $5$\textcent\rule{1pt}{0pt} stamps: \pause
\[ \{ 0, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, \ldots \} \] \pause
\item As soon as we have three consecutive achievable postages we get everything. \pause \newline
(we can add some number $3$\textcent\rule{1pt}{0pt} stamps to one of those to get any larger value.)
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{proof}
\begin{thm*}
Any postage greater than $7$\textcent\rule{1pt}{0pt} can be achieved exactly using only $3$\textcent\rule{1pt}{0pt} and $5$\textcent\rule{1pt}{0pt} stamps.
\end{thm*} \pause
\begin{itemize}
\item The proof can be completed using PCI. \pause
\item A simpler approach (IMHO) is to combine ordinary induction with the three exhaustive cases, $x=3k+8$, $x=3k+9$ and $x=3k+10$.
\end{itemize}
