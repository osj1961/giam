\section{{\em no} divisors in common?}

\begin{frame}{gcd equals one}
\begin{itemize}
\item Notice that since $1$ is a divisor of any integer, there's always at least $1$ as a common entry in two number's lists of divisors. \pause
\item Does it actually happen that for some values of $a$ and $b$, $\gcd{a}{b} = 1$? \pause
\item Sure!  For example if $a$ and $b$ are both prime.\pause
\item This also happens when the numbers are not prime but their factorizations don't have any primes in common. \pause
\item Example: $33$ and $35$. \pause
\item Or $41,140$ and $46,683$???
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{relative primality}
\begin{itemize}
\item When $\gcd{a}{b} = 1$, we say that $a$ and $b$ are {\em relatively prime}. \pause
\item Of course two distinct prime numbers will be relatively prime, but there are other possibilities\textellipsis \pause
\item Notice that when a fraction is in lowest terms (aka simplest form), the numerator and denomenator will be relatively prime.\pause
\item Example: $\displaystyle \frac{186}{210} $ \pause \hspace{.1in} $\displaystyle = \; \frac{31}{35}.$

\section{be rational}

\begin{frame}{Righting a wrong}
\begin{itemize}
\item The definition we gave for the rational numbers:

\[  \Rationals = \{ \frac{a}{b} \suchthat a \in \Integers \; \mbox{and} \;
b \in \Integers \; \mbox{and} \; b \neq 0 \} \]

\noindent has an issue. \pause

\item We're failing to take account of the fact that the same rational number can be written in multiple ways. \pause

\item In a sense this is okay since when duplicates occur in a set we automatically drop them. \pause

\item But in another sense it's problematic because how are we supposed to know that $2/3$ and $4/6$ are actually the same?  (I know you know they're the same, but shouldn't the definition of $\Rationals$ be the place where issues like that get sorted?) \pause

\item The final officially approved version of $\Rationals$:

\[  \Rationals = \{ \frac{a}{b} \suchthat a \in \Integers \; \mbox{and} \;
b \in \Integers \; \mbox{and} \; b \neq 0 \; \mbox{and} \; \gcd{a}{b} = 1 \} \]

\begin{frame}{are there irrational numbers?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Pythagoras -- ``all is number'' \pause
\item For quite a while people believed that the rational numbers were the biggest set of numbers we needed -- in other words they thought all physical quantities (lengths, weights, areas, etc) were rational.\pause
\item You probably {\em believe} in irrational numbers (real numbers that aren't rational) because you know that the decimal expansion of things like $\pi$ and $\sqrt{3}/2$ don't have a repeating pattern. \pause
\item But if you're being honest with yourself, you probably just took somebody's word for that.\pause

\begin{frame}{the proof}

\begin{theorem}
$\sqrt{2} \notin \Rationals$
\end{theorem}

\emph{Proof:}
Suppose to the contrary that $\sqrt{2}$ {\em is} a rational number.
Then by the definition of the set of rational numbers, we know that
there are integers 
$a$ and $b$ having the following properties: 
$\displaystyle \sqrt{2} = \frac{a}{b}$ and $\gcd{a}{b} = 1$.  

Consider the expression $\displaystyle \sqrt{2} = \frac{a}{b}$.   
By squaring both sides of this we obtain

\[ 2 = \frac{a^2}{b^2}. \]

This last expression can be rearranged to give

\begin{equation*}
a^2 = 2 b^2
\end{equation*}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{cont}

An immediate consequence of this last equation is that $a^2$ is an
even number.  Using the lemma, we deduce that $a$ is an even
integer and hence that there is an integer $m$ such that $a=2m$.
Substituting this last expression into the previous equation gives

\begin{equation*}
(2m)^2 = 2 b^2,
\end{equation*}

thus,

\begin{equation*}
4m^2 = 2 b^2,
\end{equation*}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{cont}

so

\begin{equation*}
2m^2 = b^2.
\end{equation*}

This tells us that $b^2$ is even, and hence (by the lemma), $b$ is even.

Finally, we have arrived at the desired absurdity because if $a$ and
$b$ are both even then $\gcd{a}{b} \geq 2$, but, on the other hand,
one of our initial assumptions is that $\gcd{a}{b} = 1$.
