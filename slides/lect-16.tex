\section{contradiction}

\begin{frame}{layout}
\begin{itemize}
\item  Assume the conclusion you wish to prove is actually false.\pause
\item From that premise deduce a complete absurdity (i.e.\ a contradiction) \pause
\item Since $\lnot P$ is equivalent to $c$ we deduce that $P \cong t$. \pause
\item Back in chapter 1 we saw a proof of this type -- the proof that $\sqrt{2}$ is not rational. \pause
\item Next we'll look at this theorem: \pause
\begin{thm} (Euclid) The set of all prime numbers is infinite.
\end{thm}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{infinitely many primes}

\noindent {\em Proof:}

\noindent Suppose on the contrary that there are only a finite number
of primes.  This finite set of prime numbers could, in principle, be listed
in ascending order.

\[  \{ p_1, p_2, p_3, \ldots , p_n \} \]

Consider the number $N$ formed by adding 1 to the product of all of these 
primes.

\[ N = 1 + \prod_{k=1}^n p_k \]

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{infinitely many primes (cont.)}

Clearly, $N$ is much larger than the largest prime $p_n$, so $N$ cannot
be a prime number itself.  Thus $N$ must be a product of some of the 
primes in the list.  Suppose that $p_j$ is one of the primes that 
divides $N$.  Now notice that, by construction, $N$ would leave remainder
$1$ upon division by $p_j$.  This is a contradiction since we cannot have
both $p_j \divides N$ and $p_j \nmid N$. 

Since the supposition that there are only finitely many primes leads to
a contradiction, there must indeed be an infinite number of primes.

\hspace{\fill} Q.E.D.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{a short digression}
\begin{itemize}
\item The notation $p\#$ is used for the product of all the primes up to and including $p$. \pause
\item This is pronounced ``$p$ prime-orial.'' \pause
\item The number $N$ in our proof could have been expressed as $p_n\# + 1$. \pause
\item An incorrect (but somehow attractive) way to end the proof might be ``$N$ must be a prime since it isn't divisible by any of the known primes, so we've discovered a prime larger than the largest prime.  Which is a contradiction.'' \pause
\item This isn't quite right because while $N$ implies the existence of primes bigger than $p_n$, it's not necessary for $N$ itself to be prime. \pause
\item But is it? \pause Let's use CoCalc.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{another example}
\begin{itemize}
\item  There is no largest integer. \pause

\noindent {\em Proof:}

Suppose (by way of contradiction) that there is a largest integer $L$.   
Then $L \in \Integers$ and $\forall z \in \Integers, L \geq z$.
Consider the quantity $L+1$.  Clearly $L+1$ is an integer (because it is the sum of two integers) and also
$L+1 > L$.   This is a contradiction so the original supposition is false.   Hence there is no largest integer.

\hspace{\fill} Q.E.D.

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{yet another example}
\begin{itemize}
\item  Prove that the sum of a rational and an irrational 
number is irrational.\pause

\noindent {\em Proof:}

\noindent Suppose (by way of contradiction) that $x$ is a rational number, that $y$ is an irrational number, and that $x+y$ is rational. 
Note that $y = (x+y) - x$ is the difference of two rational numbers.  By a previous result, the difference of rational numbers is rational.  This is a contradiction since it is impossible for $y$ to be both rational and irrational, so the original supposition is false.   Hence the sum of a rational and an irrational 
number must be irrational.

\section{contrapositives}

\begin{frame}{layout}
\begin{itemize}
\item  You'll start with an opening sentence that says something like:\pause \newline

``We will instead consider the equivalent statement (contrapositive of whatever we really want to prove).'' \pause
\item Then we just do a regular direct proof of that contrapositive statement.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{a long anticipated lemma proof}
\begin{itemize}
\item  Recall the lemma we wanted for the proof that $\sqrt{2} \notin \Rationals$ ? \pause
\item $ \displaystyle \forall x \in \Integers, \; x^2 \; \mbox{is even} \; \implies \; x \;  \mbox{is even.} $ \pause \newline
\noindent {\em Proof:} \newline
\noindent We will instead consider the equivalent statement,
\[ \forall x \in \Integers, \; x \; \mbox{is odd} \; \implies \; x^2 \;  \mbox{is odd.}  \]
\noindent (This is the contrapositive of the desired result.) \newline
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{lemma (cont.)}

Suppose that $x$ is a particular, but arbitrary odd number.  By the definition of `odd' we know that there is an integer $k$ such that $x = 2k+1$.  Note that $x^2 = (2k+1)^2 = 4k^2+4k+1$, by substitution and simple algebra.  Finally, we see that $x^2 = 2(2k^2+2k) + 1$ satisfies the definition of `odd' because $2k^2 + 2k$ is the sum of products of integers, which is an integer.

\section{some LaTeX hints}

\begin{frame}{environments}
\begin{itemize}
\item Environments are used to typeset things of the same type in a reusable way. \pause
\item Let's open up Overleaf and check out the theorem and proof environments.
