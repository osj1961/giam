\item Determine the logical form of the following arguments.  Use symbols
to express that form and determine whether the form is valid or invalid.
If the form is invalid, determine the type of error made.  Comment on the 
soundness of the argument as well, in particular, determine whether any of
the premises are questionable.
\begin{enumerate}
\item All who are guilty are in prison. \newline
  George is not in prison.  \newline
  Therefore, George is not guilty.
 
 \wbvfill
 
  \hint{ 
  This looks like modus tollens.  Let $G$ refer to ``guilt'' and $P$ refer to ``in prison''
  
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cl}
 & $\forall x, G(x) \implies P(x)$ \\
 & ${\lnot}P(\mbox{George}) $ \\ \hline
$\therefore$ & ${\lnot}G(\mbox{George})$ \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

You should note that while the form is valid, there is something terribly wrong with this argument.  Is it really true that everyone who is guilty of a crime is in prison?

truth values have already been filled-in.  You only need to identify the critical rows and 
verify that the conclusion is true in those rows.

\item If we allow quantifiers and open sentences in an argument form we
get a couple of new argument forms.  Arguments involving existentially quantified 
premises are rare -- the new forms we are speaking of are called ``universal modus 
ponens'' and ``universal modus tollens.''   The minor premises may also be quantified
or they may involve particular elements of the universe of discourse -- this leads
us to distinguish argument subtypes that are termed ``universal'' and ``particular.''

For example  \begin{tabular}{cl}
 & $\forall x, A(x) \implies B(x)$ \\
 & $A(p)$ \\ \hline
$\therefore$ & $B(p)$ \\
\end{tabular}  is the particular form of universal modus ponens (here, $p$
is not a variable -- it stands for some particular element of the universe of
discourse)
and \begin{tabular}{cl}
 & $\forall x, A(x) \implies B(x)$ \\
 & $\forall x, {\lnot}B(x)$ \\ \hline
$\therefore$ & $\forall x, {\lnot}A(x)$ \\
\end{tabular} is the universal form of (universal) modus tollens.

Reexamine the arguments from problem (1), determine their forms
(including quantifiers) and whether they are universal or particular.

\hint{
Hint: All of them except for one are the particular form -- number 4 is the exception.

Here's an analysis of number 5:

All fish live in water. \newline
The octopus lives in water.  \newline
Therefore, the octopus is a fish. \newline

Let $F(x)$ be the open sentence ``x is a fish'' and let $W(x)$ be the open sentence ``x lives in water.''

Our argument has the form

 \begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cl}
 & $\forall x, F(x) \implies W(x)$ \\
 & $W(\mbox{the octopus}) $ \\ \hline
$\therefore$ & $F(\mbox{the octopus})$ \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Clearly something is wrong -- a converse error has been made -- if everything that lived in water was necessarily a fish the argument would be OK (in fact it would then be the particular form of universal modus ponens).  But that is the converse of the major premise given.

\item Read the following proof that the sum of two odd numbers is even.
Discuss the rules of inference used.\\
\begin{proof}
Let $x$ and $y$ be odd numbers.  Then $x=2k+1$
and $y=2j+1$ for some integers $j$ and $k$.  By algebra,
\[
x+y = 2k+1 + 2j+1 = 2(k+j+1).
\]

Note that $k+j+1$ is an integer because $k$ and $j$ are integers.
Hence $x+y$ is even. 
\end{proof}

\hint{The definition for ``odd'' only involves the oddness of a single integer, but the first line of our
proof is a conjunction claiming that $x$ and $y$ are both odd.  It seems that two conjunctive simplifications, followed by applications of the definition, followed by a conjunctive addition have been used in order to
go from the first sentence to the second.}

\item Sometimes in constructing a proof we find it necessary to ``weaken'' an inequality.  For example,
we might have already deduced that $x < y$ but what we need in our argument is that $x \leq y$.  It is
okay to deduce $x \leq y$ from $x < y$ because the former is just shorthand for $x<y \lor x=y$.  What
rule of inference are we using in order to deduce that $x \leq y$ is true in this situation?
