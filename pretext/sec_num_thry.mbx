    <title>Even and odd</title>
    <p>
      If you divide a number by 2 and it comes out even (i.e. with
      no remainder) the number is said to be <em>even</em>. So the
      <em>word</em> even is related to division. It turns out that the
      <em>concept</em> even is better understood through thinking about
      multiplication.
    </p>

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          An integer <m>n</m> is <term>even</term> exactly when there is an integer <m>m</m>
          such that <m>n = 2m</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      You should note that there is a <q>two-way street</q> sort of quality
      to this definition <mdash /> indeed with most, if not all, definitions. If
      a number is even, then we are guaranteed the existence of another
      integer half as big. On the other hand, if we can show that another
      integer half as big exists, then we know the original number is even.
      This two-wayness means that the definition is what is known as a
      <em>biconditional</em>, a concept which we'll revisit in
      <xref ref="sec_impl">Section</xref>.
    </p>

    <p>
      A lot of people don't believe that <m>0</m> should be counted as an even
      number. Now that we are armed with a precise definition, we can
      answer this question easily. Is there an integer <m>x</m> such that
      <m>0 = 2x</m> ? Certainly! let <m>x</m> also be <m>0</m>. (Notice that in the
      definition, nothing was said about <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> being distinct from
      one another.)
    </p>

    <p>
      An integer is <em>odd</em> if it isn't even. That is, amongst integers,
      there are only two possibilities: even or odd. We can also define
      oddness without reference to <q>even.</q>

        <p>
          An integer <m>n</m> is <term>odd</term> exactly when there is an integer <m>m</m>

  <subsection xml:id="base-n">
    <title>Decimal and base-<em>n</em> notation</title>
    <p>
      You can also identify even numbers by considering their
      decimal representation. Recall that each digit in the
      decimal representation of a number has a value that depends
      on its position. For example, the number <m>3482</m> really means
      <m>3\cdot10^3 + 4\cdot10^2 + 8\cdot10^1 + 2\cdot10^0</m>. This
      is also known as <index><main>place notation</main></index>place notation.
      The fact that we use the
      powers of 10 in our place notation is probably due to the
      fact that most humans have 10 fingers. It is possible to
      use <em>any</em> number in place of 10. In Computer Science there
      are 3 other bases in common use: 2, 8 and 16 <mdash /> these are
      known (respectively) as binary, octal and hexadecimal notation.
      When denoting a number using some base other than 10, it is
      customary to append a subscript indicating the base.
      So, for example, <m>1011_2</m> is binary notation meaning
      <m>1\cdot2^3 + 0\cdot2^2 + 1\cdot2^1 + 1\cdot2^0</m> or <m>8+2+1 = 11</m>.
      No matter what base we are using, the rightmost digit of
      the number multiplies the base raised to the <m>0</m>-th power.
      Any number raised to the <m>0</m>-th power is 1, and the rightmost
      digit is consequently known as the units digit. We are now
      prepared to give some statements that are equivalent to our
      definition of even. These statements truly don't deserve the
      designation <q>theorem,</q> they are immediate consequences of the
      definition.
    </p>

    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          An integer is <em>even</em> if the units digit in its decimal
          representation is one of 0, 2, 4, 6 or 8.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          An integer is <em>even</em> if the units digit in its binary
          representation is 0.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    <p>
      For certain problems it is natural to use some particular notational system.
      For example, the
      last theorem would tend to indicate that binary numbers are useful
      in problems dealing with even and odd. Given that there are many different
      notations that are available to us, it is obviously desirable to have
      means at our disposal for converting between them. It is possible to
      develop general rules for converting a base-<m>a</m> number to a base-<m>b</m>
      number (where <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are arbitrary) but it is actually more convenient
      to pick a <q>standard</q> base (and since we're human we'll use base-<m>10</m>)
      and develop methods for converting between an arbitrary base and the
      <q>standard</q> one. Imagine that in the not-too-distant future we need to
      convert some numbers from the base-<m>7</m> system used by the Seven-lobed
      Amoebazoids from Epsilon Eridani III to the base-<m>12</m> scheme favored
      by the Dodecatons of Alpha-Centauri IV. We will need a procedure
      for converting base-<m>7</m> to base-<m>10</m> and another procedure for converting
      from base-<m>10</m> to base-<m>12</m>. In the School House Rock episode
      <q>Little Twelve Toes</q> they describe base-<m>12</m>
      numeration in a way that is understandable for elementary school
      children <mdash /> the digits they use are
      <m>\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, \delta, \epsilon \}</m>, the last two digits
      (which are pronounced <q>dec</q> and <q>el</q>) are necessary since we need
      single symbols for the things we ordinarily denote using <m>10</m> and <m>11</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Converting from some other base to decimal is easy. You just use the
      definition of place notation. For example, to find what <m>451663_7</m>
      represents in decimal, just write
      <me>
        4 \cdot 7^5 + 5 \cdot 7^4 + 1 \cdot 7^3 + 6 \cdot 7^2 + 6 \cdot 7 + 3 =  4 \cdot 16807 + 5 \cdot 2401 + 1 \cdot 343 + 6 \cdot 49 + 6 \cdot 7 + 3 = 79915.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      (Everything in the line above can be interpreted as a base-<m>10</m> number,
      and no subscripts are necessary for base-<m>10</m>.)
    </p>

    <p>
      Converting from decimal to some other base is harder. There is an algorithm
      called <q>repeated division</q> that we'll explore a bit in the exercises
      for this section. For the moment, just verify that
      <m>3\delta 2\epsilon 7_{12}</m> is also a representation of the
      number more conventionally written as 79915.

  <subsection xml:id="div">
    <title>Divisibility</title>
    <p>
      The notion of being even has an obvious generalization. Suppose
      we asked whether <m>3</m> divided evenly into a given number. Presumably
      we could make a definition of what it meant to be <em>threeven</em>, but
      rather than doing so (or engaging in any further punnery) we shall
      instead move to a general definition. We need a notation for the
      situation when one number divides evenly into another. There are
      many ways to describe this situation in English, but essentially
      just one in <q>math,</q> we use a vertical bar <mdash /> <em>not</em> a fraction
      bar. Indeed the difference between this vertical bar and the
      fraction symbol (<m>\divides</m> versus <m>/</m>) needs to
      be strongly stressed. The vertical bar
      when placed between two numbers is a symbol which asks the question
      <q>Does the first number divide evenly (i.e. with no remainder) into
      the second?</q> On the other hand the fraction bar asks you to actually
      carry out some division. The value of <m>2\divides 5</m> is <em>false</em>, whereas
      the value of <m>2/5</m> is <m>.4</m>
    </p>

    <p>
      As was the case in defining even, it turns out that it is best
      to think of multiplication, not division, when making a formal
      definition of this concept. Given any two integers <m>n</m> and <m>d</m>
      we define the symbol <index><main>divisibility</main></index><m>d\divides n</m> by
    </p>

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          <m>d \divides n</m> exactly when <m>\exists k \in \Integers</m> such that <m>n = kd</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      In spoken language the symbol <m>d \divides n</m> can be translated in a variety
      of ways:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>d</m> is a divisor of <m>n</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>d</m> divides <m>n</m> evenly.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>d</m> is a factor of <m>n</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>n</m> is an integer multiple of <m>d</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Although, by far the most popular way of expressing this concept is to just say <q><m>d</m> divides <m>n</m>.</q>

    <title>Floor and ceiling</title>
    <p>
      Suppose there is an elevator with a capacity of 1300 pounds. A large
      group of men who all weigh about 200 pounds want to ascend in it. How
      many should ride at a time? This is just a division problem, 1300/200
      gives 6.5 men should ride together. Well, obviously putting half a
      person on an elevator is a bad idea <mdash /> should we just round-up and
      let 7 ride together? Not if the 1300 pound capacity rating doesn't
      have a safety margin! This is an example of the kind of problem
      in which the floor function is used. The <index><main>floor function</main></index>
      floor function takes a real number as input and returns the next
      lower integer.
    </p>

    <p>
      Suppose after a party we have 43 unopened bottles of beer. We'd like
      to store them in containers that hold 12 bottles each. How many
      containers will we need? Again, this is simply a division problem <mdash /> <m>43/12 = 3.58\overline{333}</m>. So we need 3 boxes and another
      7 twelfths of a box. Obviously we really need 4 boxes <mdash /> at least one
      will have some unused space in it. In this sort of situation
      we're dealing with the <index><main>ceiling function</main></index>ceiling function.
      Given a real number, the ceiling function rounds it up to the
      next integer.
    </p>

    <p>
      Both of these functions are denoted using symbols that look very
      much like absolute value bars. The difference lies in some
      small horizontal strokes.
    </p>

    <p>
      If <m>x</m> is a real number, its floor is denoted <m>\lfloor x \rfloor</m>,
      and its ceiling is denoted <m>\lceil x \rceil</m>. Here are the
      formal definitions:
    </p>

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          <m>y = \lfloor x \rfloor</m> exactly when <m>y \in \Integers</m> and
          <m>y \leq x \lt  y+1</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          <m>y = \lceil x \rceil</m> exactly when <m>y \in \Integers</m> and
          <m>y-1 \lt  x \leq y</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      Basically, the definition of floor says that <m>y</m> is an integer
      that is less than or equal to <m>x</m>, but <m>y+1</m> definitely exceeds <m>x</m>.
      The definition of ceiling can be paraphrased similarly.

      In the next section we'll discuss the so-called division algorithm <mdash /> this may be over-kill since you certainly already know how to do
      division! Indeed, in the U.S., long division is usually first studied
      in the latter half of elementary school, and division problems that
      don't involve a remainder may be found as early as the first grade.
      Nevertheless, we're going to discuss this process in sordid detail
      because it gives us a good setting in which to prove relatively easy
      statements. Suppose you are setting-up a long division problem in
      which the integer <m>n</m> is being divided by a positive divisor <m>d</m>.
      (If you want to divide by a negative number, just divide by the
      corresponding positive number and then throw an extra minus sign
      on at the end.)

      Recall that the answer consists of two parts, a <em>quotient</em> <m>q</m>,
      and a <em>remainder</em> <m>r</m>. Of course, <m>r</m> may be zero, but also, the
      largest <m>r</m> can be is <m>d-1</m>. The assertion that this answer uniquely
      exists is known as the <index><main>quotient-remainder theorem</main></index>
      <em>quotient-remainder theorem</em>:

    <theorem xml:id="quo-rem">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Given integers <m>n</m> and <m>d>0</m>, there are unique integers <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> such
          that <m>n = qd + r</m> and <m>0 \leq r \lt  d</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>

    <p>
      The words <q>div</q> and <q>mod</q> that appear in the title of this
      subsection provide mathematical shorthand for <m>q</m> and <m>r</m>. Namely,
      <q><m>n \bmod d</m></q> is a way of expressing the remainder <m>r</m>, and <q><m>n
      \tdiv d</m></q> is a way of expressing the quotient <m>q</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      If two integers, <m>m</m> and <m>n</m>, leave the same remainder when you
      divide them by <m>d</m>, we say that they are <index><main>congruence</main></index>
      <em>congruent modulo <m>d</m></em>.
      One could express this by writing <m>n \bmod d = m \bmod d</m>, but usually
      we adopt a shorthand notation
      <me>
        n \equiv m \pmod{d}.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      If one is in a context in which it is completely clear what <m>d</m> is, it's
      acceptable to just write <m>n \equiv m</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <q>mod</q> operation is used quite a lot in mathematics. When we do
      computations modulo some number <m>d</m>, (this is known as <q>modular arithmetic</q>
      or, sometimes, <q>clock arithmetic</q>) some very nice properties of <q>mod</q>
      come in handy:
      <me>
        x + y \bmod d = ( x \bmod d + y \bmod d ) \bmod d
      </me>
      and
      <me>
        x \cdot y \bmod d = ( x \bmod d \cdot y \bmod d ) \bmod d.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      These rules mean that we can either do the operations first, then
      reduce the answer <m>\bmod\; d</m> or we can do the reduction <m>\bmod\; d</m>
      first and then do the operations (although we may have to do one
      more round of reduction <m>\bmod\; d</m>).
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, if we are working <m>\bmod\; 10</m>, and want to compute
      <m>87 \cdot 96 \bmod\; 10</m>, we can instead just compute <m>7 \cdot 6 \bmod\; 10</m>,
      which is <m>2</m>.

      Notice that in the triangle there is a border on both sides containing
      1's and that the numbers on the inside of the triangle are the sum of the
      two numbers above them. You can use these facts to extend the triangle.

      Binomial coefficients are denoted using a somewhat strange looking
      symbol. The number in the <m>k</m>-th position in row number <m>n</m> of
      the triangle is denoted <m>\displaystyle \binom{n}{k}</m>. This looks
      a little like a fraction, but the fraction bar is missing. Don't
      put one in! It's <em>supposed</em> to be missing. In spoken English
      you say <q><m>n</m> choose <m>k</m></q> when you encounter the symbol <m>\displaystyle \binom{n}{k}</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is a formula for the binomial coefficients <mdash /> which is nice. Otherwise
      we'd need to complete a pretty huge Pascal triangle in order to compute
      something like <m>\displaystyle \binom{52}{5}</m>. The formula involves
      <index><main>factorials</main></index> factorial notation. Just to be sure we are
      all on the same page, we'll define factorials before proceeding.
    </p>

    <p>
      The symbol for factorials is an exclamation point following a number.
      This is just a short-hand for expressing the
      product of all the numbers up to a given one.
      For example <m>7!</m> means <m>1\cdot 2\cdot 3\cdot 4\cdot 5\cdot 6\cdot 7</m>.
      Of course, there's really no need to write the initial <m>1</m> <mdash /> also,
      for some reason people usually write the product in decreasing order
      (<m>7! = 7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2)</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The formula for a binomial coefficient is
      <me>
        \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k! \cdot (n-k)!}.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      For example
      <me>
        \binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3! \cdot (5-3)!} = \frac{1\cdot 2\cdot 3\cdot 4\cdot 5}{(1\cdot 2\cdot 3) \cdot (1\cdot 2)} = 10.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      A slightly more complicated example (and one that gamblers are fond of)
      is
      <md>
        <mrow>\binom{52}{5} = \frac{52!}{5! \cdot (52-5)!} 
         = \frac{1\cdot 2\cdot 3\cdot \cdots 52}{(1\cdot 2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) \cdot (1\cdot 2 \cdot 3\cdot \cdots 47)}</mrow>
        <mrow>= \frac{48 \cdot 49 \cdot 50 \cdot 51 \cdot 52}{1\cdot 2\cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5} = 2598960.</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      The reason that a gambler might be interested in the number we just calculated
      is that binomial coefficients do more than just give us the coefficients in the
      expansion of a binomial. They also can be used to compute how many ways one
      can choose a subset of a given size from a set. Thus <m>\binom{52}{5}</m> is the
      number of ways that one can get a 5 card hand out of a deck of 52 cards.

            One method of converting from decimal to some other base is

            One divides the number by the base
            and records the remainder <mdash /> one then divides the quotient obtained
            by the base and records the remainder. Continue dividing the
            successive quotients by the base until the quotient is smaller than
            the base. Convert 3267 to base-7 using repeated division. Check
            your answer by using the meaning of base-7 place notation. (For

            (As a check, the 4-tuple next to <m>A</m> in the table for

            It is a well known fact that if a number is divisible by 3, then 3
            divides the sum of the (decimal) digits of that number. Is this

            You have to try a bunch of examples. You should try to make sure the examples
            you try cover all the possibilities. The pairs that provide counterexamples (i.e. show the statement is false in general) are relatively sparse, so be systematic.
