    The concept of a function is one of the most useful abstractions
    in mathematics. In fact it is an abstraction that can be further
    abstracted! For instance an <!--Style me with CSS--><em>operator</em>
    is an entity which takes functions as inputs and produces functions
    as outputs, thus an operator is to functions as functions themselves
    are to numbers. There are many operators that you have certainly
    encountered already — just not by that name. One of the most
    famous operators is “differentiation,” when you take the derivative
    of some function, the answer you obtain is another function.
    If two different people are given the same differentiation problem
    and they come up with different answers, we <!--Style me with CSS--><em>know</em> that at least
    one of them has made a mistake! Similarly, if two calculations of the
    value of a function are made for the same input, they <!--Style me with CSS--><em>must</em> match.
  </p>
<p id="p-1209">
    The property we are discussing used to be captured by saying that a
    function needs to be “well-defined.” The old school definition of a
    function was:

    A more modern definition of a function is the following.

<p id="p-1212">
        A <em class="terminology">function</em> is a binary relation which does not contain
        distinct pairs having the same initial element.
      </p></article><p id="p-1213">
    When we think of a function as a special type of binary relation,
    the pairs that are “in” the function have the form \((x, f(x))\),
    that is, they consist of an input and the corresponding output.
  </p>
<p id="p-1214">
    We have gotten relatively used to relations “on” a set, but recall
    that the more general situation is that a binary relation is
    a subset of \(A \times B\). In this setting, if the relation is
    actually a function \(f\), we say that \(f\) is a function <!--Style me with CSS--><em>from</em> \(A\emph{to}B\). Now, quite often there are input values that simply don't
    work for a given function (for instance the well-known “you can't take
    the square root of a negative” rule). Also, it is often the case that
    certain outputs just can't happen. So, when dealing with a function
    as a relation contained in \(A \times B\) there are actually four sets
    that are of interest — the sets \(A\) and \(B\) (of course) but also some
    sets that we'll denote by \(A'\) and \(B'\). The set \(A'\) consists of those
    elements of \(A\) that actually appear as the first coordinate of a pair
    in the relation \(f\). The set \(B'\) consists of those elements of \(B\)
    that actually appear as the second coordinate of a pair in the relation \(f\).
    A generic example of how these four sets might look is given in <a knowl="./knowl/fig_generic_function.html" knowl-id="xref-fig_generic_function" alt="Figure 6.4.3 " title="Figure 6.4.3 ">Figure 6.4.3</a>.
  </p>
<figure class="figure-like" id="fig_generic_function"><img width="100%" src="images/3773292f0c8831b3ef36257060e3ec94c0790646.png" alt=""><img width="100%" src="images/e4da943afd93931db3290c98ac0d461cf87b9e29.png" alt=""><figcaption><span class="heading">Figure</span><span class="codenumber">6.4.3</span>The sets related to an arbitrary function.</figcaption></figure><p id="p-1215">
    Sadly, only three of the sets we have just discussed are known to
    the mathematical world. The set we have denoted \(A'\) is called the
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>domain</em> of the function \(f\). The set we have denoted \(B'\) is
    known as the <!--Style me with CSS--><em>range</em> of the function \(f\). The set we have denoted
    \(B\) is called the <!--Style me with CSS--><em>codomain</em> of the function \(f\). The set we
    have been calling \(A\) does not have a name. In fact, the formal
    definition of the term “function” has been rigged so that there
    is no difference between the sets \(A\) and \(A'\). This seems a shame,
    if you think of range and domain as being primary, doesn't it seem
    odd that we have a way to refer to a superset of the range (i.e. the
    codomain) but no way of referring to a superset of the domain?
  </p>
<p id="p-1216">
    Nevertheless, this is just the way it is … There is only one
    set on the input side — the domain of our function.
  </p>
<p id="p-1217">
    The domain of
    any relation is expressed by writing \(\Dom{\relR}\). Which is
    defined as follows.
  </p>
<article class="definition-like" id="definition-13"><h5 class="heading">
<span class="type">Definition</span><span class="codenumber">6.4.4</span>
</h5>
<p id="p-1218">
        If \(\relR\) is a relation from \(A\) to \(B\) then \(\Dom{\relR}\) is
        a subset of \(A\) defined by
        \begin{equation*}
          \Dom{\relR} = \{a \in A \suchthat \exists b \in B, (a,b) \in \relR \}
        \end{equation*}
      </p></article><p id="p-1219">
    We should point out that the notation just given for the domain of a
    relation \(\relR\), (\(\Dom{\relR}\)) has analogs for the other
    sets that are involved with a relation. We write \(\Cod{\relR}\)
    to refer the the codomain of the relation, and \(\Rng{\relR}\)
    to refer to the range.
  </p>
<p id="p-1220">
    Since we are now thinking of functions as special classes of relations, it follows that a function is just
    a set of ordered pairs. This means that the identity of a function is
    tied up, not just with a formula that gives the output for a given input,
    but also with what values can be used for those inputs. Thus the function
    \(f(x)=2x\) defined on \(\Reals\) is a completely different animal from
    the function \(f(x)=2x\) defined on \(\Naturals\). If you really want to
    specify a function precisely you must give its domain as well as a
    formula for it. Usually, one does this by writing a formula, then a
    semicolon, then the domain. (E.g. \(f(x)=x^2;  x \geq 0\).)
  </p>
<p id="p-1221">
    Okay, so, finally, we are prepared to give the real
    definition of a function.
  </p>
<article class="definition-like" id="definition-14"><h5 class="heading">
<span class="type">Definition</span><span class="codenumber">6.4.5</span>
</h5>
<p id="p-1222">
        If \(A\) and \(B\) are sets, then \(f\) is a function from \(A\) to \(B\) (which
        is expressed symbolically by \(f:A\longrightarrow B\)), if and only if
        \(f\) is a subset of \(A\times B\), \(\Dom{f}=A\) and \(((a,b) \in f \; \land \; (a,c) \in f \; \implies \; b=c\).
      </p></article><p id="p-1223">
    Recapping, a function <!--Style me with CSS--><em>must</em> have its domain equal to the set \(A\)
    where its inputs come from. This is sometimes expressed by saying that
    a function is <!--Style me with CSS--><em>defined</em> on its domain. A function's range and codomain
    may be different however. In the event that the range and codomain <!--Style me with CSS--><em>are</em>
    the same (\(\Cod{\relR} = \Rng{\relR}\))
    we have a rather special situation and the function is graced by
    the appellation “surjection.” The term “onto” is also commonly used
    to describe a surjective function.
  </p>
<article class="exercise-like" id="exercise-53"><h5 class="heading">

<p id="p-1224">
        There is an expression in mathematics, “Every function is onto its
        range.” that really doesn't say very much. Why not?
      </p></article><div class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"></div>
<p id="p-1225">
    If one has elements \(x\) and \(y\), of the domain and codomain, (respectively)
    and \(y = f(x)\)<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-40" id="fn-40"><span class="footnote"><sup> 2 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-40" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">Or, equivalently, \((x,y) \in f\).</span></span> then one may
    say that “\(y\) is the image of \(x\)” or that
    “\(x\) is a preimage of \(y\).” Take careful note of the articles used in
    these phrases — we say “\(y\) is <!--Style me with CSS--><em>the</em> image of \(x\)” but
    “\(x\) is <!--Style me with CSS--><em>a</em> preimage of \(y\).” This is because \(y\) is uniquely determined
    by \(x\), but not vice versa. For example, since the squares of \(2\) and \(-2\) are
    both \(4\), if we consider the function \(f(x) = x^2\), the image of (say) \(2\)
    is \(4\), but a preimage for \(4\) could be either \(2\) or \(-2\).
  </p>
<p id="p-1226">
    It would be pleasant if there were a nice way to refer to the preimage of
    some element, \(y\), of the range. One notation that you have probably
    seen before is “\(f^{-1}(y)\).” There is a major difficulty with writing
    down such a thing. By writing “\(f^{-1}\)” you are making a rather
    vast presumption — that there actually is a function that serves as an
    inverse for \(f\). Usually, there is not.
  </p>
<p id="p-1227">
    One can define an inverse for any relation, the inverse is formed by
    simply exchanging the elements in the ordered pairs that make up \(\relR\).

<p id="p-1228">
        The <em class="terminology">inverse relation</em> of a relation \(\relR\)
        is denoted \(\relR^{-1}\) and

          \relR^{-1} = \{ (y,x) \suchthat (x,y) \in \relR \}.
        \end{equation*}
      </p></article><p id="p-1229">
    In terms of graphs, the inverse and the original relation are related
    by being reflections in the line \(y=x\). It is possible for one, both,
    or neither of these to be functions. The canonical example to keep
    in mind is probably \(f(x) = x^2\) and its inverse.

    The graph that we obtain by reflecting \(y=f(x)=x^2\) in the line \(y=x\) doesn't
    pass the vertical line test and so it is the graph of (merely) a relation — not of a function. The function \(g(x) = \sqrt{x}\) that we all know
    and love is not truly the inverse of \(f(x)\). In fact this function is
    defined to make a specific (and natural) choice — it returns the positive
    square root of a number. But this leads to a subtle problem; if we start
    with a negative number (say \(-3\)) and square it we get a positive number (\(9\))
    and if we then come along and take the square root we get another positive
    number (\(3\)). This is problematic since we didn't end up where we started
    which is what ought to happen if we apply a function followed by its inverse.
  </p>
<p id="p-1231">
    We'll try to handle the general situation in a bit, but for the moment let's
    consider the nice case: when the inverse of a function is also a function.
    When exactly does this happen? Well, we have just seen that the inverse
    of a function doesn't necessarily pass the vertical line test, and it turns
    out that that is the predominant issue. So, under what circumstances does
    the inverse pass the vertical line test? When the original function
    passes the so-called horizontal line test (every horizontal line
    intersects the graph at most once). Thinking again about \(f(x)=x^2\), there
    are some horizontal lines that miss the graph entirely, but all horizontal
    lines of the form \(y=c\) where \(c\) is positive will intersect the graph twice.
    There are many functions that <!--Style me with CSS--><em>do</em> pass the horizontal line test, for
    instance, consider \(f(x) = x^3\). Such functions are known as
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>injections</em>, this is the same thing as
    saying a function is “one-to-one.” Injective functions can be inverted — the domain of the inverse function of \(f\) will only be the range, \(\Rng{f}\),
    which as we have seen may fall short of the being the entire codomain, since
    \(\Rng{f} \subseteq \Cod{f}\).
  </p>
<p id="p-1232">
    Let's first define injections in a way that is divorced from thinking
    about their graphs.

        A function \(f(x)\) is an <em class="terminology">injection</em> iff for all pairs of
        inputs \(x_1\) and \(x_2\), if \(f(x_1) = f(x_2)\) then \(x_1=x_2\).

    This is another of those defining properties that is designed so
    that when it is true it is vacuously true. An injective function
    never takes two distinct inputs to the same output. Perhaps the
    cleanest way to think about injective functions is in terms of
    preimages — when a function is injective, preimages are unique.
    Actually, this is a good time to mention something about surjective
    functions and preimages — if a function is surjective, every element
    of the codomain <!--Style me with CSS--><em>has</em> a preimage. So, if a function has both
    of these properties it means that every element of the codomain
    has one (and only one) preimage.
  </p>
<p id="p-1235">
    A function that is both injective and surjective (one-to-one and onto)
    is known as a <!--Style me with CSS--><em>bijection</em>. Bijections are tremendously
    important in mathematics since they provide a way of perfectly matching
    up the elements of two sets. You will probably spend a good bit of time
    in the future devising maps between sets and then proving that they are
    bijections, so we will start practicing that skill now…
  </p>
<p id="p-1236">
    Ordinarily, we will show that a function is a bijection by proving
    separately that it is both a surjection and an injection.
  </p>
<p id="p-1237">
    To show that a function is surjective we need to show that it is
    possible to find a preimage for every element of the codomain. If
    we happen to know what the inverse function is, then it is easy to
    find a preimage for an arbitrary element. In terms of the taxonomy
    for proofs that was introduced in <a href="ch_proof1.html" alt="Chapter 3 Proof techniques I — Standard methods" title="Chapter 3 Proof techniques I — Standard methods">Chapter 3</a>, we are talking
    about a constructive proof of an existential statement. A function \(f\)
    is surjective iff \(\forall y \in \Cod{f}, \exists x \in \Dom{f}, 
    y = f(x)\), so to prove surjectivity is to find the \(x\) that “works” for an
    arbitrary \(y\). If this is done by literally naming \(x\), we have
    proved the statement constructively.
  </p>
<p id="p-1238">
    To show that a function
    is an injection, we traditionally prove that the property used in the
    definition of an injective function is true. Namely, we suppose that
    \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) are distinct elements of \(\Dom{f}\) and that
    \(f(x_1)=f(x_2)\) and then we show that actually \(x_1 = x_2\). This is
    in the spirit of a proof by contradiction — if there were actually
    distinct elements that get mapped to the same value then \(f\) would <!--Style me with CSS--><em>not</em>
    be injective, but by deducing that \(x_1=x_2\) we are contradicting that
    presumption and so, are showing that \(f\) is indeed an injection.
  </p>
<p id="p-1239">
    Let's start by looking at a very simple example,
    \(f(x)=2x-1; \; x \in \Naturals\). Clearly this function
    is not a surjection if we are thinking that \(\Cod{f}=\Naturals\)
    since the outputs are always odd. Let \({\mathcal O} = \{1, 3, 5, 7, \ldots \}\)
    be the set of odd naturals.

      First we will show that \(f\) is surjective. Consider an arbitrary element
      \(y\) of the set \(\mathcal O\). Since \(y \in {\mathcal O}\) it follows that
      \(y\) is both positive and odd. Thus there is an integer \(k\), such that
      \(y=2k+1\), but also \(y&gt;0\). From this it follows that \(2k+1 &gt;0\) and so
      \(k &gt; -1/2\). Since \(k\) is also an integer, this last inequality implies
      that \(k \in \Znoneg\). (Recall that \(\Znoneg = \{0,1,2,3, \ldots \}\).) We can easily verify that a preimage
      for \(y\) is \(k+1\), since \(f(k+1) = 2(k+1)-1 = 2k+2-1 = 2k+1 = y\).
    </p>
<p id="p-1242">
      Next we show that \(f\) is injective. Suppose that there are two input
      values, \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) such that \(f(x_1) = f(x_2)\). Then \(2x_1-1 = 2x_2-1\)
      and simple algebra leads to \(x_1=x_2\).

    For a slightly more complicated example
    consider the function from \(\Naturals\) to \(\Integers\) defined by

<p id="p-1244">
    This function does quite a handy little job, it matches up the natural
    numbers and the integers in pairs. Every even natural gets matched with
    a positive integer and every odd natural (except 1) gets matched with a
    negative integer (1 gets paired with 0). This function is really doing
    something remarkable — common sense would seem to indicate that the integers
    must be a larger set than the naturals (after all \(\Naturals\) is completely

      It suffices to find a preimage for an arbitrary element of \(\Integers\).
      Suppose that \(y\) is a particular but arbitrarily chosen integer. There
      are two cases to consider: \(y\leq 0\) and \(y&gt;0\).
    </p>
<p id="p-1248">
      If \(y&gt;0\) then \(x=2y\) is a preimage for \(y\). This follows easily since
      \(x=2y\) is obviously even and so \(x\)'s image will be
      defined by the first case in the definition of \(f\). Thus \(f(x) = f(2y) =
      (2y)/2 = y\).
    </p>
<p id="p-1249">
      If \(y \leq 0\) then \(x=1-2y\) is a preimage for \(y\). Clearly, \(1-2y\) is odd
      whenever \(y\) is an integer, thus this value for \(x\) will fall into the second
      case in the definition of \(f\). So, \(f(x) = f(1-2y) = -((1-2y)-1)/2 = -(-2y)/2 = y\).
    </p>
<p id="p-1250">
      Since the cases \(y&gt;0\) and \(y\leq 0\) are exhaustive (that is, every \(y\) in
      \(\Integers\) falls into one or the other of these cases), and we have found
      a preimage for \(y\) in both cases, it follows that \(f\) is surjective.

<p id="p-1251">
      Next, we will show that \(f\) is injective.

<p id="p-1252">
      Suppose that \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) are elements of \(\Naturals\) and that
      \(f(x_1)=f(x_2)\). Consider the following three cases: \(x_1\) and \(x_2\)
      are both even, both odd, or have opposite parity.
    </p>
<p id="p-1253">
      If \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) are both even, then by the definition of \(f\) we
      have \(f(x_1) = x_1/2\) and \(f(x_2) = x_2/2\) and since these functional
      values are equal, we have \(x_1/2 = x_2/2\). Doubling both sides of this
      leads to \(x_1=x_2\).
    </p>
<p id="p-1254">
      If \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) are both odd, then by the definition of \(f\) we
      have \(f(x_1) = -(x_1-1)/2\) and \(f(x_2) = -(x_2-1)/2\) and since these functional
      values are equal, we have \(-(x_1-1)/2 = -(x_2-1)/2\). A bit more
      algebra (doubling, negating and adding one to both sides) leads to
      \(x_1=x_2\).
    </p>
<p id="p-1255">
      If \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) have opposite parity, we will assume w.l.o.g. that
      \(x_1\) is even and \(x_2\) is odd. The equality \(f(x_1)=f(x_2)\) becomes
      \(x_1/2 = -(x_2-1)/2\). Note that \(x_1 \geq 2\) so \(f(x_1) = x_1/2 \geq 1\).
      Also, note that \(x_2 \geq 1\) so
      \begin{gather*}
x_2 - 1 \geq 0\\
(x_2-1)/2 \geq 0\\
-(x_2-1)/2 \leq 0\\
f(x_2) \leq 0
\end{gather*}
      therefore we have a contradiction since it is impossible
      for the two values \(f(x_1)\) and \(f(x_2)\) to be equal while \(f(x_1) \geq 1\)
      and \(f(x_2) \leq 0\).
    </p>
<p id="p-1256">
      Since the last case under consideration leads to a contradiction, it follows
      that \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) never have opposite parities, and so the first two
      cases are exhaustive — in both of those cases we reached the desired
      conclusion that \(x_1 = x_2\) so it follows that \(f\) is injective.

    We'll conclude this section by mentioning that the ideas of “image”

        Georg Cantor developed a systematic way of listing the rational numbers.
        By “listing” a set one is actually developing a bijection from \(\Naturals\) to

        are indexed by positive integers and whose columns are indexed by non-negative
