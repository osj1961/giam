    Many results in mathematics are answers to “How many …” questions.
  </p>
<p id="p-1319">
    “How many subsets does a finite set have?”
  </p>
<p id="p-1320">
    “How many handshakes will transpire when \(n\) people first meet?”
  </p>

    “How many functions are there from a set of size \(n\) to a set of size \(m\)?”
  </p>
<p id="p-1322">
    The title of this section, “Counting,” is not intended to evoke the usual
    process of counting sheep, or counting change. What we want is to be able
    to count some collection <!--Style me with CSS--><em>in principle</em> so that we will be able to
    discover a formula for its size.
  </p>
<p id="p-1323">
    There are two principles that will be indispensable in counting things.
    These principles are simple, yet powerful, and they have been named in
    the most unimaginative way possible. The “multiplication rule” which
    tells us when we should multiply, and the “addition rule” which tells
    us when we should add.
  </p>
<p id="p-1324">
    Before we describe these principles in detail,
    we'll have a look at a simpler problem which is most easily described
    by an example: How many integers are there in the list \((7,8,9,\ldots 44)\)?
    We could certainly write down all the integers from \(7\) to \(44\) (inclusive)
    and then count them — although this wouldn't be the best plan if the numbers
    \(7\) and \(44\) were replaced with (say) \(7,045,356\) and \(22,355,201\). A method
    that does lead to a generalized ability to count the elements of a finite
    sequence arises if we think carefully about what exactly a finite sequence
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>is</em>.
  </p>

<p id="p-1325">
        A <em class="terminology">sequence from a set \(S\)</em> is a function from
        \(\Naturals\) to \(S\).

<p id="p-1326">
        A <em class="terminology">finite sequence from a set \(S\)</em> is a
        function from \(\{0, 1, 2, \ldots , n\}\) to \(S\), where \(n\) is some
        particular (finite) integer.
      </p></article><p id="p-1327">
    Now it is easy to see that there are \(n+1\) elements in the set
    \(\{0, 1, 2, \ldots , n \}\) so counting the elements of a finite
    sequence will be easy if we can determine the function involved
    and figure out what \(n\) is by inverting it (\(n\) is an inverse image
    for the last element in a listing of the sequence).
  </p>
<p id="p-1328">
    In the example that we started with, the function is \(f(x)=x+7\). We
    can sum up the process that allows us to count the sequence by saying
    ``there is a one-to-one correspondence between the lists
    \begin{equation*}
      (7, 8, 9, \ldots , 44 )
    \end{equation*}
    and
    \begin{equation*}
      (0, 1, 2, \ldots , 37 )
    \end{equation*}
    and the later has \(38\) entries.''
  </p>
<p id="p-1329">
    More generally, if there is a list of consecutive numbers beginning
    with \(k\) and ending with \(n\), there will be \(n-k+1\) entries in the
    list. Lists of consecutive integers represent a relatively simple
    type of finite sequence. Usually we would have some slightly more
    interesting function that we'd need to invert.
  </p>
<p id="p-1330">
    The following exercise involves inverting the function \((x+5)^2\).

    We will have a lot more practice with counting the elements of sequences
    in the exercises at the end of this section, let's continue on our
    tour of counting by having a look at the addition rule.
  </p>
<p id="p-1333">
    The addition rule says that it is appropriate to add if we can
    partition a collection into <!--Style me with CSS--><em>disjoint</em> pieces. In other words,
    if a set \(S\) is the union of two or more subsets and these subsets
    are mutually disjoint, we can find the size of \(S\) by adding the sizes
    of the subsets.
  </p>
<p id="p-1334">
    In the game Yahtzee, one rolls 5 dice and (optionally) performs a
    second roll of some or all of the dice. The object is to achieve
    several final configurations that are modeled after the hands in
    Poker. In particular, one configuration, known as a “full house,”
    is achieved by having two of one number and three of another.
    (Colloquially, we say “three-of-a-kind plus a pair is a full house.”)
  </p>
<p id="p-1335">
    Now, we could use Yahtzee “hands” to provide us with a whole collection
    of counting problems once we have our basic counting principles,
    but for the moment we just want to make a simple (and obvious) point
    about “full houses” — the pair is either smaller or larger than
    the three-of-a-kind. This means we can partition the set of all possible
    full houses into two disjoint sets — the full houses consisting of a small
    pair and a larger three-of-a-kind and those where the pair is larger
    than the three-of-a-kind. If we can find some way of counting these
    two cases separately, then the total number of full houses will be the
    sum of these numbers.

    The multiplication rule gives
    us a way of counting things by thinking
    about how we might construct them. The numbers that are multiplied
    are the number of choices we have in the construction process.
    Surprisingly often, the number of choices we can make in a given
    stage of constructing some configuration is independent of the choices
    that have gone before — if this is not the case the multiplication rule
    may not apply.
  </p>
<p id="p-1337">
    If some object can be constructed in \(k\) stages, and if in the first
    stage we have \(n_1\) choices as to how to proceed, in the second stage
    we have \(n_2\) choices, <!--Style me with CSS--><em>et cetera</em>. Then the total number of such
    objects is the product \(n_1n_2 \cdots n_k\).
  </p>
<p id="p-1338">
    A <!--Style me with CSS--><em>permutation of an \(n\)-set</em> (w.l.o.g. \(\{1,2,\ldots , n\}\)) is an ordered \(n\)-tuple where each entry is a distinct element of the
    \(n\)-set. Generally, a permutation may be regarded as a bijection from
    an \(n\)-set to itself. Our first use of the multiplication rule will
    be to count the total number of permutations of \(\{1, 2, 3, \ldots ,n\}\).
  </p>
<p id="p-1339">
    Let's start by counting the permutations of \(\{1, 2, 3\}\).
    A permutation will be a 3-tuple containing the numbers \(1\), \(2\) and
    \(3\) in some order. We will think about building such a thing in
    three stages. First,
    we must select a number to go in the first position — there are \(3\) choices.
    Having made that choice, there will only be two possibilities for the number
    in the second position. Finally there is just one number remaining to put in
    the third position<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-43" id="fn-43"><span class="footnote"><sup> 1 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-43" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">People may say you have “no choice” in this 
    last situation, but what they mean is that you have only one choice.</span></span>.
    Thus there are \(3\cdot 2\cdot 1 = 6\) permutations of a \(3\) element set.
  </p>
<p id="p-1340">
    The general rule is that there are \(n!\) permutations of \(\{1, 2, \ldots , n\}\).
  </p>
<p id="p-1341">
    There are times when configurations that are like permutations (in that they
    are ordered and have no duplicates) but don't consist of all \(n\) numbers
    are useful.

        A <em class="terminology">\(k\)-permutation from an \(n\)-set</em> is an ordered selection
        of \(k\) distinct elements from a set of size \(n\).
      </p></article><p id="p-1343">
    There are certain natural limitations on the value of \(k\), for instance \(k\)
    can't be negative — although (arguably) \(k\) can be 0, it makes more sense
    to think of \(k\) being at least 1. Also, if \(k\) exceeds
    \(n\) we won't be able to find <!--Style me with CSS--><em>any</em> \(k\)-permutations,
    since it will be impossible
    to meet the “distinct” requirement. If \(k\) and \(n\) are equal, there is
    no difference between a \(k\)-permutation and an ordinary permutation.
    Therefore, we ordinarily restrict \(k\) to lie in the range \(0 \lt  k \lt  n\).
  </p>
<p id="p-1344">
    The notation \(P(n,k)\) is used for the total number of \(k\)-permutations
    of a set of size \(n\). For example, \(P(4,2)\) is 12, since there are
    twelve different ordered pairs having distinct entries where the
    entries come from \(\{1,2,3,4\}\).

    Counting \(k\)-permutations using the multiplication rule is easy. We
    build a \(k\)-permutation in \(k\) stages. In stage 1, we pick the first
    element in the permutation — there are \(n\) possible choices. In
    stage 2, we pick the second element — there are now only \(n-1\) choices
    since we may not repeat the first entry. We keep going like this until
    we've picked \(k\) entries. The number \(P(n,k)\) is the product of \(k\)
    numbers beginning with \(n\) and descending down to \(n-k+1\). To verify
    that \(n-k+1\) is really the right lower limit, check that there are indeed
    \(k\) entries in the sequence
    \begin{equation*}
      (n, n-1, n-2, \ldots n-k+1).

    came to us in. In a card game one ordinarily begins sorting the cards
    so as to see what hand one has — this is a sure sign that the order the

    five cards be put in? The answer to this question is \(5! = 120\) since
    what we are discussing is nothing more than a permutation of a set of
    size 5. Thus, if we say that there are 311,875,200 different possible
    hands in 5-card poker, we are over-counting things by quite a bit! Any

    Suppose that one wishes to come up with a password for a computer
    account. There are 52 letters (both upper and lower case) 10 numerals
    and 32 symbols and punctuation marks — for a total of 94 different
    characters that
    may be used. Some system administrators can be very paranoid about
    passwords that might be guessable — for instance no password that
    appears in a dictionary should ever be used on a system where security
    is a concern. Suppose that your system administrator will reject any
    password that has repeated symbols, and that passwords must have 8
    characters. How many passwords are possible?

    This is an instance of a counting problem where we are selecting 8 things

    \(n\)-set. There are \(C(n,k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\) distinct subsets.

    Obviously, listing all such sequences would be an arduous task.
    We might start with \((1,2,3,4,5,6)\) and try to proceed in some
    orderly fashion to \((15,16,17,18,19,20)\), but unfortunately there
    are 38,760 such sequences so unless we enlist the aid of a computer
    we are unlikely to finish this job in a reasonable time. The number
    we've just given (38,760) is \(C(20,6)\) and so it would seem that we're
    claiming that this problem is really unordered selection without repetition
    of 6 things out of 20. Well, actually, some parts of this are clearly
    right — we are selecting 6 things from a set of size 20, and because
    our sequences are supposed to be <!--Style me with CSS--><em>strictly</em> increasing there will
    be no repetitions — but, a strictly increasing sequence is clearly
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>ordered</em> and the formula we are using is for <!--Style me with CSS--><em>unordered</em>
    collections.

<p id="p-1369">
    By specifying a particular ordering (strictly increasing) on the sequences
    we are counting above, we are actually removing the importance of order.
    Put another way: if order really mattered, the symbols \(1\) through \(6\)
    could be put into \(720\) different orders — but we only want to count
    one of those possibilities. Put another other way: there is a one-to-one
    correspondence between a \(6\)-subset of \(\{1,2,3, \ldots 20\}\) and a
    strictly increasing sequence. Just make sure the subset is written in
    increasing order!

    What kinds of things are we counting in the lower right part of the table?
    Unordered selections of \(k\) things out of \(n\) possibilities where there may
    (or may not!) be repetitions. The game Yahtzee provides a nice example of
    this type of configuration. When we roll 5 dice, we do not do so
    one-at-a-time, rather, we roll them as a group — the dice are
    indistinguishable so there is no way to order our set of 5 outcomes.
    In fact, it would be quite reasonable to, after one's roll, arrange the
    die in (say) increasing order. We'll repeat a bit of advice that was given
    previously: if one is free to rearrange a configuration to suit one's needs,
    that is a clue that order is <!--Style me with CSS--><em>not</em> important in the configurations
    under consideration. Finally, are repetitions allowed? The outcomes
    in Yahtzee are 5 numbers from the set \(\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}\), and while it
    is possible to have no repetitions, that is a pretty special outcome!
    In general, the same number can appear on two, or several, or even
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>all 5</em> of the die<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-46" id="fn-46"><span class="footnote"><sup> 4 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-46" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">When this happens you are supposed 
    to jump in the air and yell “Yahtzee!”</span></span>.
  </p>
<p id="p-1372">
    So, how many different outcomes
    are there when one rolls five dice? To answer this question it will
    be helpful to think about how we might express such an outcome.
    Since order is unimportant, we can choose to put the numbers that appear
    on the individual die in whatever order we like. We may as well place them
    in increasing order. There will be 5 numbers and each number is between 1
    and 6. We can list the outcomes systematically by starting with an all-ones
    Yahtzee:
  </p>
<table></table>
<p id="p-1373">
    Whew … err, I mean, Yahtzee!
  </p>
<p id="p-1374">
    You can describe a generic element of the above listing by saying “It starts
    with some number of 1's (which may be zero), then there are some 2's (again,
    it might be that there are zero 2's), then some (possibly none) 3's,
    then some 4's (or maybe not), then some
    5's (I think you probably get the idea) and finally some 6's (sorry for
    all the parenthetical remarks).”
  </p>
<p id="p-1375">
    We could, of course, actually count the
    outcomes as listed above (there are 252) but that would be pretty dull — and
    it wouldn't get us any closer to solving such problems in general. To
    count things like Yahtzee rolls it will turn out that we can count something
    related but much simpler — blank-comma arrangements. For the Yahtzee
    problem we count arrangements of 5 blanks and 5 commas. That is,
    things like { \rule{.4pt}{1.2pt}\rule{9pt}{.4pt}\rule{.4pt}{1.2pt}\rule{.4pt}{1.2pt}\rule{9pt}{.4pt}\rule{.4pt}{1.2pt},\rule{.4pt}{1.2pt}\rule{9pt}{.4pt}\rule{.4pt}{1.2pt},,\rule{.4pt}{1.2pt}\rule{9pt}{.4pt}\rule{.4pt}{1.2pt},\rule{.4pt}{1.2pt}\rule{9pt}{.4pt}\rule{.4pt}{1.2pt},} and
    { \rule{.4pt}{1.2pt}\rule{9pt}{.4pt}\rule{.4pt}{1.2pt}\rule{.4pt}{1.2pt}\rule{9pt}{.4pt}\rule{.4pt}{1.2pt}\rule{.4pt}{1.2pt}\rule{9pt}{.4pt}\rule{.4pt}{1.2pt}\rule{.4pt}{1.2pt}\rule{9pt}{.4pt}\rule{.4pt}{1.2pt}\rule{.4pt}{1.2pt}\rule{9pt}{.4pt}\rule{.4pt}{1.2pt},,,,,} and

    These arrangements of blanks and commas correspond uniquely to Yahtzee
    rolls — the commas serve to separate different numerical values
    and the blanks are where we would write-in the 5 outcomes on the die.

    It may seem at first that this blank-comma thing is okay, but that we're
    still no closer to answering the question we started with. It may seem
    that way until you realize how easy it is to count these blank-comma
    arrangements! You see, there are 10 symbols in one of these blank-comma
    arrangements
    and if we choose positions for (say) the commas, the blanks will have to go
    into the other positions — thus every 5-subset of \(\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\}\)
    gives us a blank-comma arrangement and every one of <!--Style me with CSS--><em>them</em> gives us
    a Yahtzee outcome. That is why there are \(C(10, 5) = 252\) outcomes
    listed in the giant tabulation above.
  </p>
<p id="p-1382">
    In general, when we are selecting \(k\) things from a set of size \(n\)
    (with repetition and without order) we will need to consider
    blank-comma arrangements having \(k\) blanks and \(n-1\) commas. As an
    aid to memory, consider that when you actually write-out the elements
    of a set it takes one fewer commas than there are elements — for example
    \(\{1,2,3,4\}\) has 4 elements but we only need 3 commas to separate them.
    The general answer to our problem is either \(C(k+n-1,k)\) or
    \(C(k+n-1, n-1)\), depending on whether you want to think about
    selecting positions for the \(k\) blanks or for the \(n-1\) commas.
    It turns out that these binomial coefficients are equal so there's
    no problem with the apparent ambiguity.
  </p>
<p id="p-1383">
    So, finally, our table of counting formulas is complete. We'll produce
    it here one more time and, while we're at it, ditch the \(C(n,k)\) notation in
