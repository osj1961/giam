<span class="type">Section</span><span class="codenumber">7.2</span><span class="title">Parity and Counting arguments</span>
</h1></header><p id="p-1345">
    This section is concerned with two very powerful elements of the
    proof-making arsenal: “Parity” is a way of referring to the result of
    an even/odd calculation; Counting arguments most often take the form of
    counting some collection in two different ways — and then comparing
    those results. These techniques have little to do with one another,
    but when they are applicable they tend to produce really elegant little
    arguments.
  </p>
<p id="p-1346">
    In (very) early computers and business machines, paper cards were used to
    store information. A so-called “punch card” or
     “Hollerith card” was used to store
    binary information by means of holes punched into it. Paper tape
    was also used in a similar fashion. A typical paper tape format would
    involve 8 positions in rows across the tape that might or might not be
    punched, often a column of smaller holes would appear as well which
    did not store information but were used to drive the tape through the
    reading mechanism on a sprocket. Tapes and cards could be “read” either
    by small sets of electrical contacts which would touch through a punched
    hole or be kept separate if the position wasn't punched, or by using a
    photo-detector to sense whether light could pass through the hole or not.
    The mechanisms for reading and writing on these paper media were amazingly
    accurate, and allowed early data processing machines to use just a couple
    of large file cabinets to store what now fits in a jump drive one can
    wear on a necklace. (About 10 or 12 cabinets could hold a gigabyte
    of data).
  </p>
<p id="p-1347">
    Paper media was ideally suited to storing binary information, but of course
    most of the real data people needed to store and process would be
    alphanumeric<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-44" id="fn-44"><span class="footnote"><sup> 1 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-44" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">“Alphanumeric” is a somewhat
    antiquated term that refers to information containing both alphabetic 
    characters and numeric characters — as well as punctuation marks, etc.</span></span>.
    There were several encoding schemes that served to translate between the
    character sets that people commonly used and the binary numerals that could
    be stored on paper. One of these schemes still survives today — ASCII.
    The American Standard Code for Information Interchange uses 7-bit binary
    numerals to represent characters, so it contains 128 different symbols.
    This is more than enough to represent both upper- and lower-case
    letters, the 10 numerals, and the punctuation marks — many of the
    remaining spots in the ASCII code were used to contain so-called
    “control characters” that were associated with functionality that
    appeared on old-fashioned teletype equipment — things like “ring the bell,”
    “move the carriage backwards one space,” “move the carriage
    to the next line,” etc. These control characters are why modern
    keyboards still have a modifier key labeled “Ctrl” on them. The
    following listing gives the decimal and binary numerals from 0 to 127
    and the ASCII characters associated with them — the non-printing and
    control characters have a 2 or 3 letter mnemonic designation.
  </p>
<table></table>
<p id="p-1348">
    Now it only takes 7 bits to encode the 128 possible values in the
    ASCII system, which can easily be verified by noticing that the left-most
    bits in all of the binary representations above are 0. Most computers
    use 8 bit words or “bytes” as their basic units of information, and the
    fact that the ASCII code only requires 7 bits lead someone to think up
    a use for that additional bit. It became a “parity check bit.” If the
    seven bits of an ASCII encoding have an odd number of 1's, the parity
    check bit is set to 1 — otherwise, it is set to 0. The result of this
    is that, subsequently, all of the 8 bit words that encode ASCII data will have
    an even number of 1's. This is an example of a so-called  error detecting
    code known as the “even code” or the “parity check code.” If
    data is sent over a noisy telecommunications channel, or is stored in
    fallible computer memory, there is some small but calculable probability
    that there will be a “bit error.” For instance, one computer might
    send 10000111 (which is the ASCII code that says “ring the bell”) but
    another machine across the network might receive 10100111 (the 3rd bit from
    the left has been received in error) now if we are only looking at the
    rightmost seven bits we will think that the ASCII code for a single quote
    has been received, but if we note that this piece of received data has an
    odd number of ones we'll realize that something is amiss. There are other
    more advanced coding schemes that will let us not only <!--Style me with CSS--><em>detect</em> an
    error, but (within limits) <!--Style me with CSS--><em>correct</em> it as well! This rather amazing
    feat is what makes wireless telephony (not to mention communications
    with deep space probes — whoops! I mentioned it) work.

<p id="p-1349">
    The concept of parity can be used in many settings to prove some
    fairly remarkable results.

    In <a href="sec_eq_rel.html" alt="Section 6.3 Equivalence relations" title="Section 6.3 Equivalence relations">Section 6.3</a> we introduced the idea of a graph. This
    notion was first used by  Leonhard Euler to solve
    a recreational math problem posed by the citizens of
    Königsberg, Prussia (this is the city now known
    as  Kaliningrad, Russia.) Königsberg was situated
    at a place where two branches of the  Pregel river<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-45" id="fn-45"><span class="footnote"><sup> 2 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-45" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">Today, this river is known as the Pregolya.</span></span> come together — there is also
    a large island situated near this confluence. By Euler's time, the city of
    Königsberg covered this island as well as the north and south banks of the
    river and also the promontory where the branches came together. A network of
    seven bridges had been constructed to connect all these land masses. The
    townsfolk are alleged to have become enthralled by the question of whether it
    was possible to leave one's home and take a walk through town
    which crossed each of the bridges exactly once and, finally, return to one's
    home.
  </p>

    Euler settled the question (it can't be done) be converting the map of
    Königsberg into a graph and then making some simple observations about
    the parities of the nodes in this graph. The  degree of a node
    in a graph is the number of edges that are incident with it (if a so-called
    “loop edge” is present it adds two to the node's degree). The “parity
    of a node” is shorthand for the “parity of the <!--Style me with CSS--><em>degree</em> of the node.”
  </p>
<figure class="figure-like" id="figure-17"><img width="100%" src="images/3773292f0c8831b3ef36257060e3ec94c0790646.png" alt=""><img width="100%" src="images/c8858de7c1312ecc7247c4836283abd03ea3d051.png" alt=""></figure><p id="p-1352">
    The graph of Königsberg has 4 nodes: one of degree 5 and three of degree
    3. All the nodes are odd. Would it be possible to either modify
    Königsberg or come up with an entirely new graph having some even nodes?
    Well, the answer to that is easy — just tear down one of the bridges, and two
    of the nodes will have their degree changed by one; they'll both become even.
    Notice that, by removing one edge, we effected the parity of two nodes. Is
    it possible to create a graph with four nodes in which just one of them is
    even? More generally, given any short list of natural numbers, is it
    possible to draw a graph whose degrees are the listed numbers?

    To help get things rolling (just in case you haven't

    is possible to draw a graph, for the second it is not.
    Can you distinguish the pattern? What makes one list

    The question of whether a graph having a given list of vertex degrees
    can exist comes down to an elegant little argument using both of the
    techniques in the title of this section. We count the edge set of the
    graph in two ways — once in the usual fashion and once by summing the
    vertex degrees; we also note that since this latter count is actually
    a double count we can bring in the concept of parity.
  </p>
<p id="p-1372">
    Another perfectly lovely argument involving parity arises in questions
    concerning whether or not it is possible to tile a pruned chessboard
    with dominoes. We've seen dominoes before in <a href="sec_induct.html" alt="Section 5.1 The principle of mathematical induction" title="Section 5.1 The principle of mathematical induction">Section 5.1</a>
    and we're just hoping you've run across chessboards before. Usually
    a chessboard is 8 × 8, but we would like to adopt a more
    liberal interpretation that a chessboard can be any rectangular grid
    of squares we might choose.<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-46" id="fn-46"><span class="footnote"><sup> 3 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-46" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">The game known as “draughts” in the
    UK and “checkers” in the US is played on an \(8 \times 8\) board, but 
    (for example) international draughts is played on a \(10 \times 10\) 
    board and Canadian checkers is played on a \(12 \times 12\) board.</span></span>
    Suppose that we have a supply of dominoes that are of just the right
    size that if they are laid on a chessboard they perfectly cover two
    adjacent squares. Our first question is quite simple. Is it possible
    to perfectly tile an \(m \times n\) chessboard with such dominoes?
  </p>
<p id="p-1373">
    First let's specify the question a bit more. By “perfectly tiling”
    a chessboard we mean that every domino lies (fully) on the board,
    covering precisely two squares, and that every square of the board
    is covered by a domino.
  </p>
<p id="p-1374">
    The answer is straightforward. If at least one of \(m\) or \(n\) is even
    it can be done. A necessary condition is that the number of squares
    be even (since every domino covers two squares) and so, if both \(m\)
    and \(n\) are odd we will be out of luck.
  </p>
<p id="p-1375">
    A “pruned board” is obtained by either literally removing some of the
    squares or perhaps by marking them as being off limits in some way.
    When we ask questions about perfect tilings of pruned chessboards things
    get more interesting and the notion of parity can be used in several
    ways.
  </p>
<p id="p-1376">
  Here are two tiling problems regarding square chessboards:

  <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li id="li-435"><p id="p-1377">
        An even-sided square board (e.g. an ordinary \(8 \times 8\) board) 
        with diagonally opposite corners pruned.

<li id="li-436"><p id="p-1378">
        An odd-sided board with one square pruned.
      </p></li>
</ol>
  </p>
<p id="p-1379">
    Both of these situations satisfy the basic necessary condition that
    the number of squares on the board must be even. You may be able
    to determine another “parity” approach to these tiling problems
    by attempting the following

    The pattern of black and white squares on a chessboard is an
    example of a sort of artificial parity, if we number the squares
    of the board appropriately then the odd squares will be white and
    the even squares will be black. We are used to chessboards having
    this alternating black/white pattern on them, but nothing about these
    tiling problems required that structure<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-47" id="fn-47"><span class="footnote"><sup> 4 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-47" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">Nothing about chess

    of course we invented the coloring scheme in order to solve them.
    An odd-by-odd chessboard has more squares of one color than of the other.
    An odd-by-odd chessboard needs to have a square pruned in order for it to
    be possible for it to be tiled by dominoes — but if the wrong colored
    square is pruned it will <!--Style me with CSS--><em>still</em> be impossible. Each domino covers
    two squares — one of each color! (So the pruned board must have the
    same number of white squares as black.)

    The definition of a magic square requires that the rows and columns sum to
    the same number but says nothing about what that number must be.
    It is conceivable that we could produce magic squares (of the same order)
    having different magic sums. This is <!--Style me with CSS--><em>conceivable</em>, but in fact the
    magic sum is determined completely by \(n\).

      We count the total of the entries in the magic square in two ways.
      The sum of all the entries in the magic square is
