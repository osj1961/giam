    If you form the product of 4 consecutive numbers, the result will be one
    less than a perfect square. Try it!
    \begin{equation*}
      1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 = 24 = 5^2 - 1
    \end{equation*}
    \begin{equation*}
      2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 120 = 11^2 - 1
    \end{equation*}
    \begin{equation*}
      3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 = 360 = 19^2 - 1
    \end{equation*}

    It always works!

<p id="p-561">
    The three calculations that we've carried out above constitute an
    inductive argument in favor of the result. If you like we can try
    a bunch of further examples,
    \begin{equation*}
      13 \cdot 14 \cdot 15 \cdot 16 = 43680 = 209^2 - 1
    \end{equation*}
    \begin{equation*}
      14 \cdot 15 \cdot 16 \cdot 17 = 571200 = 239^2 - 1
    \end{equation*}
    but really, no matter how many examples we produce, we haven't
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>proved</em> the statement — we've just given evidence.
  </p>
<p id="p-562">
    Generally, the first thing to do in proving a universal statement like
    this is to rephrase it as a conditional. The resulting statement is a
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>Universal Conditional Statement</em>
    or a UCS. The reason for taking
    this step is that the <!--Style me with CSS--><em>hypotheses</em> will then be clear — they form
    the antecedent of the UCS. So, while you won't have really made any
    progress in the proof by taking this advice, you will at least know what tools
    you have at hand. Taking the example we started with, and rephrasing
    it as a UCS we get
    \begin{equation*}
      \forall a,b,c,d \in \Integers, (\mbox{a,b,c,d  consecutive} ) 
      \implies \exists k \in \Integers, a{\cdot}b{\cdot}c{\cdot}d = k^2 -1
    \end{equation*}
  </p>
<p id="p-563">
    The antecedent of the UCS is that \(a,b,c\) and \(d\) must be
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>consecutive</em>. By concentrating our attention on what it
    means to be consecutive, we should quickly realize that the original
    way we thought of the problem involved a red herring. We don't need
    to have variables for all four numbers; because they are consecutive,
    \(a\) uniquely determines the other three. Finally we have a version
    of the statement that we'd like to prove that should lend itself
    to our proof efforts.

      \end{equation*}</article><p id="p-564">
    In this simplistic example, the only thing we need to do is come
    up with a value for \(k\) given that we know what \(a\) is. In other
    words, a “proof” of this statement involves doing some algebra.

      Suppose that \(a\) is a particular but arbitrarily chosen

    Now, if you followed the algebra above, (none of which was particularly
    difficult) the proof stands as a completely valid argument showing the
    truth of our proposition, but this is <!--Style me with CSS--><em>very</em> unsatisfying! All
    the real work was concealed in one stark little sentence:
    “Let \(k\) be \(a^2+3a+1\).” Where on Earth did that particular value
    of \(k\) come from? The answer to that question should hopefully
    convince you that there is a huge difference between <!--Style me with CSS--><em>devising</em>
    a proof and <!--Style me with CSS--><em>writing</em> one. A good proof can sometimes be
    somewhat akin to a good demonstration of magic, a magician doesn't
    reveal the inner workings of his trick, neither should a mathematician
    feel guilty about leaving out some of the details behind the work!
    Heck, there are plenty of times when you just have to <!--Style me with CSS--><em>guess</em>
    at something, but if your guess works out, you can write
    a perfectly correct proof.
  </p>
<p id="p-570">
    In devising the proof above, we multiplied out the consecutive numbers
    and then realized that we'd be done if we could find a polynomial in
    \(a\) whose square was \(a^4  + 6a^3 + 11a^2 + 6a + 1\). Now, obviously,
    we're going to need a quadratic polynomial, and because the leading
    term is \(a^4\) and the constant term is \(1\), it should be of the form
    \(a^2 + ma + 1\). Squaring this gives \(a^4 + 2ma^3 + (m^2+2)a^2 + 2ma + 1\)
    and comparing that result with what we want, we pretty quickly realize
    that \(m\) had better be 3. So it wasn't magic after all!
  </p>
<p id="p-571">
    This seems like a good time to make a comment on polynomial arithmetic.
    
    Many people give up (or go searching for a computer algebra system)
    when dealing with products of anything bigger than binomials. This
    is a shame because there is an easy method using a table for performing
    such multiplications. As an example, in devising the previous proof we
    needed to form the product \(a(a+1)(a+2)(a+3)\), now we can use the
    distributive law or the infamous F.O.I.L rule to multiply pairs of these,
    but we still need to multiply \((a^2+a)\) with \((a^2+5a+6)\). Create a
    table that has the terms of these two polynomials as its row and column
    headings.

    In this section we are concerned with

    Such statements come in two flavors — those that appear to involve

    Okay, so this outline is pretty crappy. It tells you how to start and
    end a direct proof, but those obnoxious dot-dot-dots in the middle are
    where all the real work has to go. If I could tell you (even in outline)
    how to fill in those dots, that would mean mathematical proof isn't really
    a very interesting activity to engage in. Filling in those dots will
    sometimes (rarely) be obvious, more often it will be extremely challenging;
    it will require great creativity, loads of concentration, you'll call on
    all your previous mathematical experiences, and you will most likely
    experience a certain degree of anguish. Just remember that your sense
    of accomplishment is proportional to the difficulty of the puzzles you
    attempt. So let's attempt another…

    Now, let's try rephrasing this theorem as a UCS: If \(x\) is a real number
    and \(n\) is an integer, then \(\lfloor x + n \rfloor = \lfloor x \rfloor +  n\).
    This is bad … it appears that the only hypotheses that we can use
    involve what kinds of numbers \(x\) and \(n\) are — our hypotheses aren't
    particularly potent. Your next most useful allies in constructing proofs
    are the definitions of the concepts involved. The quantity
    \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) appears in the theorem, let's make
    use of the definition:
    \begin{equation*}
      a = \lfloor x  \rfloor \; \iff \; a \in \Integers \; \, 
      \land \; \, a \leq x \lt  a+1.
    \end{equation*}
  </p>
<p id="p-586">
    The only other floor function that appears in the statement of the theorem
    (perhaps even more prominently)
    is \(\lfloor x + n\rfloor\), here, the definition gives us
    \begin{equation*}
      b = \lfloor x + n \rfloor \; \iff \; 
      b \in \Integers \; \, \land \; \, b \leq x + n \lt  b+1.

    These definitions are our only available tools so we'll certainly <!--Style me with CSS--><em>have</em>
    to make use of them, and it's important to notice that that is a good thing;
    the definitions allow us to work with something well-understood
    (the inequalities that appear within them) rather than with something
    new and relatively suspicious (the floor notation). Putting the proof
    of this statement together is an exercise in staring at the two definitions
    above and noting how one can be converted into the other. It is also a
    testament to the power of <!--Style me with CSS--><em>naming</em> things.

    We'll close this section with a word about axioms. The axioms in any
    given area of math are your most fundamental tools. Axioms don't
    need to be proved — we are supposed to just accept them! A very common
    problem for beginning proofwriters is telling the difference between statements
    that are axiomatic and statements that require some proof. For instance, in the
    exercises for this section there is a problem that asks us to prove that the sum of
    two rational numbers is rational. Doesn't this seem like it might be one of
    the axioms of rational numbers? Is it really something that <!--Style me with CSS--><em>can</em> be proved?
    Well, we know how the process of adding rational numbers works: we put the
    fractions over a common
    denominator and then just add numerators. Do you see how adding fractions really rests
    on our ability to add the numerators (which are integers). So, in doing that exercise you
    can use the fact (indeed, you'll need to use the fact) that the sum of two integers is an integer.
    So how about <!--Style me with CSS--><em>that</em> statement? Is it necessary to prove that adding integers produces
    an integer? As a matter of fact it <!--Style me with CSS--><em>is</em> necessary since the structure of the integers
    rests on a foundation known as the Peano axioms for the naturals — and the Peano axioms
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>don't</em> include one that guarantees that the sum of two naturals is also a natural. If you
    are tempted to trace this whole thing back, to “find out how deep the rabbit hole goes,” I commend
    you. But, if you just want to be able to get on with doing your homework problems, I sympathize
    with that sentiment too. Let's agree that integers behave the way we've come to expect — if
    you add or multiply integers the result will be an integer.

           You want to argue about the sum of two generic rational numbers. Maybe call them \(a/b\) and \(c/d\). The definition of “rational number” then tells you that \(a\), \(b\), \(c\) and \(d\) are integers and that neither \(b\) nor \(d\) are zero. You add these generic rational numbers in the usual way — put them over a common denominator and then add the numerators. One possible common denominator is \(bd\), so we can express the sum as \((ad+bc)/(bd)\).  You can finish off the argument from here: you need to show that this expression for the sum satisfies the definition of a rational number (quotient of integers w/ non-zero denominator).

          Further, suppose that \(x\) is a real number satisfying the equation
          \begin{equation*}
            \frac{ax+b}{cx+d} = 1.
          \end{equation*}
          Show that \(x\) is rational.  Where is the hypothesis \(a \neq c\)
          used?

          \hint{Cross multiply and solve for \(x\).  If you need to divide by an expression, it had 
          better be non-zero!}

          Show that if two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\) satisfy \(a \divides b\emph{and}b \divides a\) then they are equal.

          \hint{From the definition of divisibility, you get two integers \(j\) and \(k\), such that 
          \(a = jb\) and \(b = ka\). Substitute one of those into the other and ask yourself what 
          the resulting equation says about \(j\) and \(k\).  Can they be any old integers?  Or, are 
          there restrictions on their values?
