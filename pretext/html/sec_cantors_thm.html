    Many people believe that the result known as Cantor's theorem says that
    the real numbers, \(\Reals\), have a greater cardinality than the natural numbers, \(\Naturals\).
    That isn't quite right. In fact Cantor's theorem is a much broader statement,
    one of whose consequences is that \(|\Reals| &gt; |\Naturals|\). Before we go
    on to discuss Cantor's theorem in full generality, we'll first explore it,
    essentially, in this simplified form.
    Once we know that \(|\Reals| \neq |\Naturals|\), we'll be in a position to
    explore a lot of
    interesting issues relative to the infinite. In particular, this result
    means that there are at least two cardinal numbers that are
    infinite — thus the “infinity is infinity” idea will be discredited.
    Once we have the full power of Cantor's
    theorem, we'll see just how completely wrong that concept is.

    To show that some pair of sets are not equivalent it is necessary to show
    that there cannot be a one-to-one correspondence between them. Ordinarily,
    one would try to argue by contradiction in such a situation. That is what
    we'll need to do to show that the reals and the naturals are not equinumerous.
    We'll presume that they are in fact the same size and try to reach a
    contradiction.
  </p>
<p id="p-1599">
    What exactly does the assumption that \(\Reals\) and \(\Naturals\) are
    equivalent mean?
    It means there is a one-to-one correspondence, that is, a bijective function
    from \(\Reals\) to \(\Naturals\). In a nutshell, it means that it is
    possible to list all the real
    numbers in a singly-infinite list. Now, it is certainly possible to make an
    infinite list of real numbers (since \(\Naturals \subseteq \Reals\),
    by listing the naturals themselves
    we are making an infinite list of reals!). The problem is that we would need
    to be sure that every real number is on the list somewhere. In fact, since
    we've used a geometric argument to show that the interval \((0, 1)\) and the
    set \(\Reals\) are equinumerous, it will be sufficient to presume that there
    is an infinite list containing all the numbers in the interval \((0, 1)\).

        Notice that, for example, \(\pi-3\) is a real number in
        \((0, 1)\). Make
        a list of \(10\) real numbers in the interval \((0, 1)\). Make sure that
        at least 5 of them are not rational.

<p id="p-1601">
    In the previous exercise, you've started the job, but we need to presume
    that it is truly possible to complete this job. That is, we must presume
    that there really is an infinite list containing every real number in
    the interval \((0, 1)\).
  </p>
<p id="p-1602">
    Once we have an infinite list containing every real number in the interval
    \((0, 1)\) we have to face up to a second issue. What does it really mean
    to list a particular real number? For instance if \(e-2\) is in the seventh
    position on our list, is it OK to write “\(e-2\)” there or should we write
    “0.7182818284590452354…”? Clearly it would be simpler to write
    “\(e-2\)” but it isn't necessarily possible to do something of that kind
    for every real
    number — on the other hand, writing down the decimal expansion is a problem
    too; in a certain sense, “most” real numbers in (0, 1) have infinitely long
    decimal expansions. There is also another problem with decimal expansions;
    they aren't unique. For example, there is really no difference between the
    finite expansion \(0.5\) and the infinitely long expansion \(0.4\overline{9}\).
  </p>
<p id="p-1603">
    Rather than writing something like “\(e-2\)” or “0.7182818284590452354…”,
    we are going to in fact write “.1011011111100001010100010110001010001010 …”
    In other words, we are going to write the base-2 expansions of the real numbers
    in our list. Now, the issue of non-uniqueness is still there in binary, and
    in fact if we were to stay in base-10 it would be possible to plug a certain
    gap in our argument — but the binary version of this argument has some
    especially nice features.
    Every binary (or for that matter decimal) expansion corresponds to a unique
    real number, but it doesn't work out so well the other way around —
    there are sometimes two different binary expansions that correspond to the
    same real number. There is a lovely fact that we are not going to prove (you
    may get to see this result proved in a course in Real Analysis) that points up
    the problem. Whenever two different binary expansions represent the same
    real number, one of them is a terminating expansion (it ends in infinitely
    many 0's) and the other is an infinite expansion (it ends in infinitely many
    1's). We won't prove this fact, but the gist of the argument is a proof by
    contradiction — you may be able to get the point by studying <span>&lt;&lt;Unresolved xref, reference "fig_binary_reps"; check spelling or use "provisional" attribute&gt;&gt;</span>.
    (Try to see how it would be possible to find a number in between two binary
    expansions that didn't end in all-zeros and all-ones.)
  </p>
<figure class="figure-like" id="figure-25"><img width="100%" src="images/3773292f0c8831b3ef36257060e3ec94c0790646.png" alt=""><img width="100%" src="images/3ce32157fb70f1f0244003cfd10fcdbc30799c13.png" alt="">\(2\)\([0, 1]\)</figure><p id="p-1604">
    So, instead of showing that the set of reals in \((0, 1)\) can't be put
    in one-to-one
    correspondence with \(\Naturals\), what we're really going to do is show
    that their binary expansions can't be put in one-to-one correspondence
    with \(\Naturals\). Since
    there are an infinite number of reals that have two different binary expansions
    this doesn't really do the job as advertised at the beginning of this section.
    (Perhaps you are getting used to our wily ways by now — yes, this does
    mean that we're going to ask you to do the real proof in the exercises.)
    The set of binary numerals, \(\{0, 1\}\), is an instance of a mathematical
    structure known as a field; basically, that means that it's possible to
    add, subtract, multiply and divide (but not divide by 0) with them.
    We are only mentioning this fact so that you'll understand why the set
    \(\{0, 1\}\) is often referred to as \({\mathbb F}_2\). We're only mentioning that
    fact so that you'll understand why we call the set of all possible
    binary expansion \({\mathbb F}_2^\infty\) . Finally, we're only mentioning <!--Style me with CSS--><em>that</em>
    fact so that we'll have a succinct way of expressing this set.
    Now we can write “\({\mathbb F}_2^\infty\)” rather than
    “the set of all possible infinitely-long binary sequences.”
  </p>
<p id="p-1605">
    Suppose we had a listing of all the elements of \({\mathbb F}_2^\infty\). We would have an
    infinite list of things, each of which is itself an infinite list
    of 0's and 1's.
  </p>
<p id="p-1606">
    So what? We need to proceed from here to find a contradiction.
  </p>
<p id="p-1607">
    This argument that we've been edging towards is known as Cantor's
    diagonalization argument. The reason for this name is that our
    listing of binary representations looks like an enormous table
    of binary digits and the contradiction is deduced by looking at
    the diagonal of this infinite-by-infinite table.
    The diagonal is itself an infinitely long binary string — in other words, the
    diagonal can be thought of as a binary expansion itself.
    If we take the complement
    of the diagonal, (switch every 0 to a 1 and vice versa) we will also
    have a thing that can be regarded as a binary expansion and this binary
    expansion can't be one of the ones on the list! This bit-flipped version of
    the diagonal is different from the first binary expansion in the first
    position,
    it is different from the second binary expansion in the second position, it is
    different from the third binary expansion in the third position, and so on.
    The very presumption that we could list all of the elements of \({\mathbb F}_2^\infty\)
    allows us
    to construct an element of \({\mathbb F}_2^\infty\) that could not be on the list!
  </p>
<p id="p-1608">
    This argument has been generalized many times, so this is the first in a
    class of things known as diagonal arguments. Diagonal arguments have been
    used to settle several important mathematical questions. There is a valid
    diagonal argument that even does what we'd originally set out to do: prove
    that \(\Naturals\) and \(\Reals\) are not equinumerous. Strangely, the
    argument can't be made to work in binary, and since you're going to be
    asked to write it up in the exercises, we want to point out one of the
    potential pitfalls.
    If we were to use a diagonal argument to show that \((0, 1)\) isn't countable,
    we would start by assuming that every element of \((0, 1)\) was written down in
    a list. For most real numbers in \((0, 1)\) we could write out their
    binary representation uniquely, but for some we would have to make a
    choice: should we write down the representation that terminates, or
    the one that ends in infinitely-many 1's? Suppose we choose to use
    the terminating representations, then none of the infinite binary
    strings that end with all 1's will be on the list. It's possible that
    the thing we get when we complement the diagonal
    is one of these (unlisted) binary strings so we don't <!--Style me with CSS--><em>necessarily</em>
    have a contradiction.
    If we make the other choice — use the infinite binary representation
    when we have a choice — there is a similar problem.
    You may think that our use of binary representations for real numbers
    was foolish in light of the failure of the argument to “go through”
    in binary.
    Especially since, as we've alluded to, it can be made to work in decimal.
    The reason for our apparent stubbornness is that these infinite binary
    strings do something else that's very nice. An infinitely long binary sequence
    can be thought of as the indicator function of a subset of N. For example,
    \(.001101010001\) is the indicator of \(\{2, 3, 5, 7, 11\}\).

    The set, \({\mathbb F}_2^\infty\), we've been working with is in one-to-one correspondence
    with the power set of the natural numbers, \({\mathcal P}(\Naturals)\).
    When viewed in this light, the proof we did above showed that the power
    set of \(\Naturals\) has an infinite cardinality strictly greater than that
    of \(\Naturals\) itself. In other words, \({\mathcal P}(\Naturals)\) is
    uncountable.

    What Cantor's theorem says is that this always works. If \(A\) is any set,
    and \({\mathcal P}(A)\) is its power set then \(|A| \lt  |{\mathcal P}(A)|\).
    In a way, this more general
    theorem is easier to prove than the specific case we just handled.

      Suppose that there is a set \(A\) that can be placed in one-to-one
      correspondence with its power set. Then there is a bijective
      function \(f : A \longrightarrow {\mathcal P}(A)\). We will deduce
      a contradiction by constructing a subset of \(A\)

      If \(S\) is in the range of \(f\), there is a preimage \(y\) such that \(S = f(y)\).
      But, if such a \(y\) exists then the membership question, \(y \in S\), must
      either be true or false. If \(y \in S\), then because \(S = f(y)\), and \(S\)
      consists of those elements that are not in their images, it follows
      that \(y \notin S\). On the other hand, if \(y \notin S\) then \(y \notin f(y)\) so
      (by the definition of \(S\)) it follows that \(y \in S\). Either possibility leads to the other, which is a contradiction.

    Cantor's theorem guarantees that there is an infinite hierarchy of infinite
    cardinal numbers. Let's put it another way. People have sought a construction
    that, given an infinite set, could be used to create a strictly larger set.
    For
    instance, the Cartesian product works like this if our sets are finite —
    \(A \times A\) is strictly bigger than \(A\) when \(A\) is a finite set. But, as
    we've already seen,
    this is not necessarily so if \(A\) is infinite (remember the “snake” argument
    that \(\Naturals\) and \(\Naturals \times \Naturals\) are equivalent). The
    real import of Cantor's theorem is that taking the power set of a set
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>does</em> create a set of larger cardinality.
    So we get an infinite tower of infinite cardinalities, starting with
    \(\aleph_0 = |\Naturals|\), by successively taking power sets.
    \begin{equation*}
      \aleph_0  = |\Naturals| \lt  |{\mathcal P}(\Naturals)| \lt  |{\mathcal P}({\mathcal P}(\Naturals))| \lt  |{\mathcal P}({\mathcal P}({\mathcal P}(\Naturals)))| \lt  \ldots
    \end{equation*}

          An argument very similar to the one embodied in the proof of Cantor's
          theorem is found in the Barber's paradox. This paradox was
          originally introduced in the popular press in order to give laypeople an
          understanding of Cantor's theorem and Russell's paradox. It sounds
          somewhat sexist to modern ears. (For example, it is presumed without
          comment that the Barber is male.)
          <blockquote>
          In a small town there is a Barber who shaves those men (and
          only those men) who do not shave themselves. Who shaves
          the Barber?
