    We've said a lot about the equivalence relation
    determined by Cantor's definition
    of set equivalence. We've also, occasionally, written things like
    \(|A| \lt  |B|\), without being particularly clear about what that means.
    It's now time to come clean. There is actually a (perhaps) more fundamental
    notion used for comparing set sizes than equivalence — dominance.
    Dominance is an ordering relation on the class of all sets.
    One should probably really define dominance first and then
    define set equivalence in terms of it. We haven't followed that plan
    for (at least) two reasons. First, many people may want to skip this
    section — the results of this section depend on the difficult
    Cantor-Bernstein-Schröder theorem<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-57" id="fn-57"><span class="footnote"><sup> 1 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-57" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">This theorem has been 
    known for many years as the Schröder-Bernstein theorem, but, 
    lately, has had Cantor's name added as well. Since Cantor proved 
    the result before the other gentlemen this is fitting. It is also 
    known as the Cantor-Bernstein theorem (leaving out Schröder) 
    which doesn't seem very nice.</span></span>. Second, we will later take the view that dominance
    should really be considered to be an ordering relation on the set of
    all cardinal numbers — i.e. the equivalence classes of the set equivalence
    relation — not on the collection of all sets. From that perspective,
    set equivalence really needs to be defined <!--Style me with CSS--><em>before</em> dominance.
  </p>
<p id="p-1624">
    One set is said to dominate another if there is a function from the latter
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>into</em> the former.
    More formally, we have the following
  </p>
<article class="definition-like" id="definition-24"><h5 class="heading">
<span class="type">Definition</span><span class="codenumber">8.4.1</span>
</h5>
<p id="p-1625">
        If \(A\) and \(B\) are sets, we say “\(A\) dominates \(B\)”
        and write \(|A| &gt; |B|\) iff there is an injective function \(f\) with
        domain \(B\) and codomain \(A\).
      </p></article><p id="p-1626">
    It is easy to see that this relation is reflexive and transitive. The Cantor-
    Bernstein-Schröder theorem proves that it is also anti-symmetric — which
    means dominance is an ordering relation. Be advised that there is an abuse
    of terminology here that one must be careful about — what are the domain
    and range of the “dominance” relation? The definition would lead us to
    think that sets are the things that go on either side of the “dominance”
    relation, but the notation is a bit more honest, “\(|A| &gt; |B|\)”
    indicates that the
    things really being compared are the cardinal numbers of sets (not the sets
    themselves). Thus anti-symmetry for this relation is
    \begin{equation*}
      (|A| &gt; |B|) \land (|B| &gt; |A|) \implies (|A| = |B|).
    \end{equation*}
  </p>
<p id="p-1627">
    In other words, if \(A\) dominates \(B\) and vice versa, then \(A\) and \(B\) are
    equivalent sets — a strict interpretation of anti-symmetry for this relation
    might lead to the conclusion that \(A\) and \(B\) are actually the same set, which
    is clearly an absurdity.
  </p>
<p id="p-1628">
    Naturally, we want to prove the Cantor-Bernstein-Schröder theorem (which
    we're going to start calling the C-B-S theorem for brevity), but first it'll be
    instructive to look at some of its consequences. Once we have the C-B-S
    theorem we get a very useful shortcut for proving set equivalences. Given
    sets \(A\) and \(B\), if we can find injective functions going between them in both
    directions, we'll know that they're equivalent. So, for example, we can use
    C-B-S to prove that the set of all infinite binary strings and the set of reals
    in (0, 1) really are equinumerous.
    (In case you had some remaining doubt… )
  </p>
<p id="p-1629">
    It is easy to dream up an injective function from \((0, 1)\)
    to \({\mathbb F}_2^\infty\) : just send a
    real number to its binary expansion, and if there are two, make a consistent
    choice — let's say we'll take the non-terminating expansion.
  </p>
<p id="p-1630">
    There is a cute thought-experiment called Hilbert's Hotel that will lead
    us to a technique for developing an injective function in the other direction.
    Hilbert's Hotel has \(\aleph_0\) rooms. If any countable collection of
    guests show up there will be enough rooms for everyone. Suppose you
    arrive at Hilbert's hotel one dark and stormy evening and the
    “No Vacancy” light is on — there are already a
    denumerable number of guests there — every room is full. The clerk
    sees you dejectedly considering your options, trying to think of
    another hotel that might still have rooms when, clearly, a <!--Style me with CSS--><em>very</em>
    large convention is in town. He rushes out and says
    “My friend, have no fear! Even though we have no vacancies,
    there is always room for one more at our establishment.”
    He goes into the office and makes the following announcement
    on the PA system. “Ladies and Gentlemen, in order to accommodate
    an incoming guest, please vacate your room and move to the room
    numbered one higher. Thank you.” There
    is an infinite amount of grumbling, but shortly you find yourself occupying
    room number \(1\).
  </p>
<p id="p-1631">
    To develop an injection from \({\mathbb F}_2^\infty\) to \((0, 1)\) we'll use “room number 1” to
    separate the binary expansions that represent the same real number. Move
    all the digits of a binary expansion down by one, and make the first digit
    \(0\) for (say) the terminating expansions and \(1\) for the non-terminating ones.
    Now consider these expansions as real numbers — all the expansions that
    previously coincided are now separated into the intervals \((0, 1/2)\) and
    \((1/2, 1)\). Notice how funny this map is, there are now
    many, many, (infinitely-many)
    real numbers with no preimages. For instance, only a subset of the rational
    numbers in \((0, 1/2)\) have preimages. Nevertheless, the map is injective, so
    C-B-S tells us that \({\mathbb F}_2^\infty\) and \((0, 1)\) are equivalent.
    There are quite a few different proofs of the C-B-S theorem. The one
    Cantor himself wrote relies on the axiom of choice. The axiom of choice
    was somewhat controversial when it was introduced, but these days most
    mathematicians will use it without qualms. What it says (essentially) is that
    it is possible to make an infinite number of choices. More precisely, it says
    that if we have an infinite set consisting of non-empty sets, it is possible
    to select an element out of each set. If there is a definable rule for picking
    such an element (as is the case, for example, when we selected the
    nonterminating decimal expansion whenever there was a choice in defining the
    injection from \((0, 1)\) to \({\mathbb F}_2^\infty\)) the axiom of choice
    isn't needed. The usual
    axioms for set theory were developed by Zermelo and Frankel, so you may
    hear people speak of the ZF axioms. If, in addition, we want to specifically
    allow the axiom of choice, we are in the ZFC axiom system. If it's possible
    to construct a proof for a given theorem without using the axiom of choice,
    almost everyone would agree that that is preferable. On the other hand,
    a proof of the C-B-S theorem, which necessarily must be able to deal with
    uncountably infinite sets, will have to depend on some sort of notion that
    will allow us to deal with huge infinities.

    The proof we will present here<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-58" id="fn-58"><span class="footnote"><sup> 2 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-58" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">We first encountered this proof 
    in a Wikipedia article <a knowl="./knowl/wiki-CBS.html" knowl-id="xref-wiki-CBS" alt="Bibliographic Entry 3 " title="Bibliographic Entry 3 ">[3]</a>.</span></span> is attributed to Julius König.
    König was a contemporary of Cantor's who was (initially) very
    much respected by him. Cantor came to dislike König after the
    latter presented a well-publicized (and ultimately wrong) lecture
    claiming the continuum hypothesis was false.
    Apparently the continuum hypothesis was one of Cantor's favorite ideas,
    because he seems to have construed König's lecture as a personal attack.
    Anyway…
  </p>
<p id="p-1633">
    König's proof of C-B-S doesn't use the axiom of choice, but it does have
    its own strangeness: a function that is not necessarily computable — that is,
    a function for which (for certain inputs) it may not be possible to compute
    an output in a finite amount of time! Except for this oddity,
    König's proof
    is probably the easiest to understand of all the proofs of C-B-S.
    Before we get too far into the proof it is essential that we understand the
    basic setup. The Cantor-Bernstein-Schröder theorem states that
    whenever \(A\)
    and \(B\) are sets and there are injective functions
    \(f : A \longrightarrow B\) and \(g : B \longrightarrow A\),
    then it follows that \(A\) and \(B\) are equivalent. Saying \(A\) and \(B\)
    are equivalent
    means that we can find a bijective function between them. So, to prove
    C-B-S, we hypothesize the two injections and somehow we must construct the
    bijection.

    <span>&lt;&lt;Unresolved xref, reference "fig_CBS_setup"; check spelling or use "provisional" attribute&gt;&gt;</span> has a presumption in it —
    that \(A\) and \(B\) are countable — which
    need not be the case. Nevertheless, it gives us a good picture to work from.
    The basic hypotheses, that \(A\) and \(B\) are sets and we have two functions, one
    from \(A\) into \(B\) and another from \(B\) into A, are shown.
    We will have to build our bijective function in a piecewise manner.
    If there is a non-empty intersection between \(A\) and \(B\), we can use the
    identity function for that part of the domain of our bijection.
    So, without
    loss of generality, we can presume that \(A\) and \(B\) are disjoint.
    We can use
    the functions \(f\) and \(g\) to create infinite sequences, which
    alternate back and
    forth between \(A\) and \(B\), containing any particular element.
    Suppose \(a \in A\) is an arbitrary element. Since \(f\) is defined
    on all of \(A\), we
    can compute \(f(a)\). Now since \(f(a)\) is an element of \(B\), and \(g\) is
    defined on all
    of \(B\), we can compute \(g(f(a))\), and so on. Thus, we get the
    infinite sequence
    \begin{equation*}
      a,   f(a),  g(f(a)),  f(g(f(a))), \; \ldots
    \end{equation*}
  </p>
<p id="p-1635">
    If the element \(a\) also happens to be the image of something under \(g\) (this
    may or may not be so — since \(g\) isn't necessarily onto) then we
    can also extend
    this sequence to the left. Indeed, it may be possible to
    extend the sequence infinitely far to the left, or, this
    process may stop when one of \(f^{-1}\) or \(g^{-1}\)
    fails to be defined.
    \begin{equation*}
      \ldots \; g^{-1}(f^{-1}(g^{-1}(a))),  f^{-1}(g^{-1}(a)),  g^{-1}(a),  a,   f(a),   g(f(a)),  f(g(f(a))),\; \ldots
    \end{equation*}
  </p>
<p id="p-1636">
    Now, every element of the disjoint union of \(A\) and \(B\) is in one of these
    sequences. Also, it is easy to see that these sequences are either disjoint
    or identical. Taking these two facts together it follows that these sequences
    form a partition of \(A \cup B\). We'll define a bijection
    \(\phi : A \longrightarrow B\) by deciding what it must do on these
    sequences. There are four possibilities for how the sequences we've
    just defined can play out. In extending them to the left, we may run
    into a place where one of the inverse functions needed isn't
    defined — or not. We say a sequence is an
    \(A\)-stopper, if, in extending to the left, we end
    up on an element of \(A\) that has
    no preimage under \(g\) (see <span>&lt;&lt;Unresolved xref, reference "fig_A-stopper"; check spelling or use "provisional" attribute&gt;&gt;</span>). Similarly,
    we can define a \(B\)-stopper.
    If the inverse functions are always defined within a given sequence there are
    also two possibilities; the sequence may be finite (and so it must be cyclic in
    nature) or the sequence may be truly infinite.

    Finally, here is a definition for \(\phi\).
    \begin{equation*}
      \phi(x) =  \left\{ \begin{array}{cl} g^{-1}(x) \amp  \mbox{if \(x\) is in a \(B\)-stopper}  \\ f(x) \amp  \mbox{otherwise} 
      \end{array}  \right.
    \end{equation*}
  </p>
<p id="p-1638">
    Notice that if a sequence is either cyclic or infinite it doesn't matter
    whether we use \(f\) or \(g^{-1}\) since both will be
    defined for all elements of such
    sequences. Also, certainly \(f\) will work if we are in an \(A\)-stopper.
    The function we've just created is perfectly well-defined, but it may take
    arbitrarily long to determine whether we have an element of a \(B\)-stopper, as
    opposed to an element of an infinite sequence. We cannot determine whether
    we're in an infinite versus a finite sequence in a prescribed finite number of
    steps.
