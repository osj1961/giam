    There is an ancient conundrum about what happens when an irresistible force
    meets an immovable object. In a similar spirit there are sometimes heated
    debates among young children concerning which super-hero will win a fight.
    Can Wolverine take Batman? What about the Incredible Hulk versus the
    Thing? Certainly Superman is at the top of the heap in this ordering. Or is
    he? Would the man of steel even engage in a fight with a female super-hero,
    say Wonder Woman? (Remember the 1950's sensibilities of Clark Kent's
    alter ego.)
  </p>
<p id="p-1543">
    To many people the current topic will seem about as sensible as the schoolyard
    discussions just alluded to. We are concerned with knowing whether
    one infinite set is bigger than another, or are they the same size. There are
    generally three reasons that people disdain to consider such questions. The
    first is that, like super-heros, infinite sets are just products of the imagination.
    The second is that there can be no difference because “infinite is infinite” — once you get to the size we call infinity, you can't add something to that to
    get to a bigger infinity. The third is that the answers to questions like this
    are not going to earn me big piles of money so “who cares?”
  </p>
<p id="p-1544">
    Point one is actually pretty valid. Physicists have determined that we
    appear to inhabit a universe of finite scope, containing a finite number of
    subatomic particles, so in reality there can be no infinite sets. Nevertheless,
    the axioms we use to study many fields in mathematics guarantee that the
    objects of consideration are indeed infinite in number. Infinity appears as a
    concept even when we know it can't appear in actuality.
    Point two, the “there's only one size of infinity” argument is wrong. We'll
    see an informal argument showing that there are at least two sizes of infinity,
    and a more formal theorem that shows there is actually an infinite hierarchy
    of infinities in <a href="sec_cantors_thm.html" alt="Section 8.3 Cantor's theorem" title="Section 8.3 Cantor's theorem">Section 8.3</a>
  </p>
<p id="p-1545">
    Point three, “who cares?” is in some sense the toughest of all to deal with.
    Hopefully you'll enjoy the clever arguments to come for their own intrinsic
    beauty. But, if you can figure a way to make big piles of money using this
    stuff that would be nice too.
  </p>
<p id="p-1546">
    Let's get started.
  </p>
<p id="p-1547">
    Which set is bigger — the natural numbers, \(\Naturals\) or the set,
    \(\Enoneg\), of nonnegative even numbers?
    Both are clearly infinite, so the “infinity is infinity” camp might be lead
    to the correct conclusion through invalid reasoning. On the other hand,
    the even numbers are contained in the natural numbers so there's a pretty
    compelling case for saying the evens are somehow smaller than the naturals.
    The mathematically rigorous way to show that these sets have the same
    cardinality is by displaying a one-to-one correspondence. Given an even
    number how can we produce a natural to pair it with? And, given a natural
    how can we produce an even number to pair with it?
    The map \(f : N \longrightarrow \Enoneg\) defined by \(f(x) = 2x\)
    is clearly a function,
    and just about as clearly, injective<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-53" id="fn-53"><span class="footnote"><sup> 1 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-53" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">If \(x\) and \(y\) are 
    different numbers that map to the same value, then f(x) = f(y) so
    2x = 2y. But we can cancel the 2's and derive that x = y, which is a contradiction.</span></span>. Is the map \(f\) also a surjection? In other
    words, is every non-negative even number the image of some natural under
    \(f\)? Given some non-negative even number \(e\) we need to be able to come
    up with an \(x\) such that \(f(x) = e\). Well, since \(e\) is an even number, by the
    definition of “even” we know that there is an integer \(k\) such that \(e = 2k\)
    and since \(e\) is either zero or positive it follows that \(k\) must also be
    either \(0\) or positive. It turns out that \(k\) is actually the \(x\) we
    are searching for. Put more
    succinctly, every non-negative even number \(2k\) has a preimage, \(k\), under the
    map \(f\). So \(f\) maps \(\Naturals\) surjectively onto \(\Enoneg\).
    Now the sets we've just considered,
    \begin{equation*}
      \Naturals \; = \; \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, \ldots \}
    \end{equation*}
    and
    \begin{equation*}
      \Enoneg \; = \; \{0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, \ldots \}
    \end{equation*}
    both have the feature that they can be listed — at
    least in principle. There is a first element, followed by a
    second element, followed by a third element,
    et cetera, in each set. The next set we'll look at, Z, can't be listed so easily.
    To list the integers we need to let the dot-dot-dots go both forward (towards
    positive infinity) and backwards (towards negative infinity),
    \begin{equation*}
      \Integers \; = \; \{ \ldots , -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots \}.
    \end{equation*}
  </p>
<p id="p-1548">
    To show that the integers are actually equinumerous with the natural
    numbers (which is what we're about to do — and by the way, isn't that pretty
    remarkable?) we need, essentially, to figure out a way to list the integers in
    a singly infinite list. Using the symbol \(\pm\) we can arrange for a singly infinite
    listing, and if you think about what the symbol \(\pm\) means you'll probably
    come up with
    \begin{equation*}
      \Integers \; = \; \{0, 1, -1, 2, -2, 3, -3, \ldots \}.
    \end{equation*}
  </p>
<p id="p-1549">
    This singly infinite listing of the integers does the job
    we're after in a sense — it displays a one-to-one correspondence with \(\Naturals\). In fact
    any singly infinite listing can be thought of as displaying a one-to-one correspondence with \(\Naturals\) — the first entry (or should we say zeroth entry?) in the list is corresponded
    with 0, the second entry is corresponded with 1, and so on.

    To make all of this precise we need to be able to explicitly give the
    one-to-one correspondence. It isn't enough to have a picture
    of it — we need a
    formula. Notice that the negative integers are all paired with even naturals
    and the positive integers are all paired with odd naturals. This observation
    leads us to a piecewise definition for a function that gives the bijection we
    seek
    \begin{equation*}
      f(x) = \left\{ \begin{array}{cl} -x/2  \amp  \mbox{if x is even} \\
      (x + 1)/2 \amp  \mbox{if x is odd} 
      \end{array}  \right. .
    \end{equation*}

<p id="p-1551">
    By the way, notice that since 0 is even it falls into the first case, and
    fortunately that formula gives the “right” value.

    The examples we've done so far have shown that the integers,
    the natural numbers and the even naturals all have the same
    cardinality. This is the first infinite cardinal number, known
    as \(\aleph_0\). In a certain sense we could view both
    of the equivalences we've shown as demonstrating that
    \(2 \cdot \infty = \infty\). Our next example will lend
    credence to the rule: \(\infty \cdot \infty = \infty\).
    The Cartesian product of two finite sets (the set of all
    ordered pairs with entries from the sets in question) has
    cardinality equal to the product of the cardinalities of
    the sets. What do you suppose will happen if we let the sets
    be infinite? For instance, what is the cardinality of
    \(\Naturals \times \Naturals\)? Consider this:
    the subset of ordered pairs that start with a 0 can be thought of as a copy
    of \(\Naturals\) sitting inside this Cartesian product. In fact
    the subset of ordered pairs
    starting with any particular number gives another copy of \(\Naturals\)
    inside \(\Naturals \times \Naturals\). There
    are infinitely many copies of \(\Naturals\) sitting inside of
    \(\Naturals \times \Naturals\)! This just really ought
    to get us to a larger cardinality. The surprising result that it
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>doesn't</em> involves an idea sometimes known as
     “Cantor's Snake” — a trick that allows
    us to list the elements of \(\Naturals \times \Naturals\) in a singly
    infinite list<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-54" id="fn-54"><span class="footnote"><sup> 2 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-54" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">Cantor's snake was originally created to show

    You can visualize the set \(\Naturals \times \Naturals\) as the
    points having integer coordinates
    in the first quadrant (together with the origin and the positive

    We need to produce a formula. In truth, we should really produce two
    formulas. One that takes an ordered pair \((x, y)\) and produces a number \(n\).
    Another that takes a number \(n\) and produces an ordered pair \((x, y)\) The
    number \(n\) tells us where the pair \((x, y)\) lies in our infinite listing.
    There is a
    problem though: the second formula (that gives the map from \(\Naturals\)
    to \(\Naturals \times \Naturals\))
    is really hard to write down — it's easier to describe the map
    algorithmically.
    A simple observation will help us to deduce the various formulas. The
    ordered pairs along the \(y\)-axis (those of the form (0, something)) correspond
    to triangular numbers. In fact the pair \((0, n)\) will correspond to the \(n\)-th triangular
    number, \(T(n) = (n^2 + n)/2\). The ordered pairs along the descending
    slanted line starting from \((0, n)\) all have the feature that the sum of their
    coordinates is \(n\) (because as the \(x\)-coordinate is increasing, the
    \(y\)-coordinate
    is decreasing). So, given an ordered pair \((x, y)\), the number corresponding
    to the position at the upper end of the slanted line it is on (which will have
    coordinates \((0, x+y)\)) will be \(T(x+y)\), and the pair \((x, y)\) occurs in the listing exactly \(x\) positions after \((0, x + y)\). Thus, the function
    \(f : \Naturals \times \Naturals \longrightarrow N\) is
    given by
    \begin{equation*}
      f(x, y) \; = \; x + T(x + y) = x + \frac{(x + y)^2 + (x + y)}{2}.
    \end{equation*}
  </p>
<p id="p-1556">
    To go the other direction — that is, to take a position
    in the listing and
    derive an ordered pair — we need to figure out where a given number lies
    relative to the triangular numbers. For instance, try to figure out what
    \((x, y)\) pair position number \(13\) will correspond with. Well, the next smaller
    triangular number is \(10\) which is \(T(4)\), so \(13\) will be the number of an
    ordered pair along the descending line whose \(y\)-intercept is \(4\).
    In fact, \(13\) will be paired
    with an ordered pair having a \(3\) in the \(x\)-coordinate (since \(13\) is \(3\)
    larger than \(10\)) so it follows that \(f^{-1}(13) = (3, 1)\).
  </p>
<p id="p-1557">
    Of course we need to generalize this procedure. One of the hardest parts
    of finding that generalization is finding the number \(4\) in the above example
    (when we just happen to notice that \(T(4)=10\) ). What we're really doing
    there is inverting the function \(T(n)\). Finding an inverse for
    \(T(n) = (n^2+n)/2\) was the essence of one of the exercises in
    <a href="sec_special_functions.html" alt="Section 6.5 Special functions" title="Section 6.5 Special functions">Section 6.5</a>.
    The parabola \(y = (x^2 + x)/2\) has roots at \(0\) and \(-1\) and is scaled by a
    factor of \(1/2\) relative to the “standard” parabola \(y = x^2\).
    Its vertex is at
    \((-1/2,-1/8)\). The graph of the inverse relation is, of course, obtained by
    reflecting through the line \(y = x\) and by considering scaling and horizontal/
    vertical translations we can deduce a formula for a function that gives a
    right inverse for \(T\),
    \begin{equation*}
      T^{-1}(x) = \sqrt{2x + 1/4} - 1/2.
    \end{equation*}
  </p>
<p id="p-1558">
    So, given \(n\), a position in the listing, we calculate \(A = \lfloor \sqrt{2n + 1/4}-1/2 \rfloor\). The \(x\)-coordinate of our ordered pair is \(n-T(A)\)
    and the \(y\)-coordinate is \(A-x\).
    It is not pretty, but the above discussion can be translated into a formula
    for \(f^{-1}\).
    \begin{gather*}
f^{-1}(n) \; = \; \left( n - \frac{ \lfloor \sqrt{2n + 1/4} - 1/2 \rfloor^2 + \lfloor \sqrt{2n + 1/4} - 1/2 \rfloor}{2} , \right.\\
\left. \lfloor \sqrt{2n + 1/4} - 1/2  \rfloor - n + \frac{\lfloor \sqrt{2n + 1/4} - 1/2 \rfloor^2 + \lfloor \sqrt{2n + 1/4} - 1/2 \rfloor}{2} \right).
\end{gather*}
  </p>
<p id="p-1559">
    When restricted to the appropriate sets (\(f\)'s domain
    is restricted to \(\Naturals \times \Naturals\)
    and \(f^{-1}\)'s domain is restricted to \(\Naturals\)),
    these functions are two-sided inverses
    for one another. That fact is sufficient to prove that \(f\)
    is bijective.
    So far we have shown that the sets \(\Enoneg\), \(\Naturals\), \(\Integers\) and
    \(\Naturals \times \Naturals\) all have
    the same cardinality — \(\aleph_0\). We plan to provide an argument that there
    actually are other infinite cardinals in the next section. Before leaving the
    present topic (examples of set equivalence) we'd like to present another nice
    technique for deriving the bijective correspondences we use to show that sets
    are equivalent — geometric constructions.
    Consider the set of points on the line segment \([0, 1]\).
    Now consider the set
    of points on the line segment \([0, 2]\). This second line
    segment, being twice as
    long as the first, must have a lot more points on it. Right?
  </p>
<p id="p-1560">
    Well, perhaps you're getting used to this sort of thing…
    The interval \([0, 1]\) is a subset of the interval \([0, 2]\),
    but since both represent infinite sets of points
    it's possible they actually have the same cardinality.
    We can prove that this is so using a geometric technique.
    We position the line segments appropriately
    and then use projection from a carefully chosen point to
    develop a bijection. Imagine both intervals as lying on
    the \(x\)-axis in the \(x\)-\(y\) plane. Shift the
    smaller interval up one unit so that it lies on the line
    \(y = 1\). Now, use projection
    from the point \((0, 2)\), to visualize the correspondence

    By considering appropriate projections we can prove that any two arbitrary
    intervals (say \([a, b]\) and \([c, d]\)) have the same cardinalities! It also
    isn't all that hard to derive a formula for a bijective function between two
    intervals.
    \begin{equation*}
      f(x) = c + \frac{(x - a)(d - c)}{(b - a)}
    \end{equation*}
  </p>
<p id="p-1562">
    There are other geometric constructions which we can use to show that
    there are the same number of points in a variety of entities. For example,
    consider the upper half of the unit circle (Remember the unit circle from
    Trig? All points \((x, y)\) satisfying \(x^2 + y^2 = 1\).) This is a
    semi-circle having a radius of 1, so the arclength of said semi-circle
    is \(\pi\). It isn't hard to imagine
    that this semi-circular arc contains the same number of points as an interval
    of length \(\pi\), and we've already argued that all intervals contain the same
    number of points… But, a nice example of geometric projection —
    vertical projection (a.k.a. \(\pi_1\)) — can be used to show that
    (for example) the interval
    \((-1, 1)\) and the portion of the unit circle lying in the upper
    half-plane are equinumerous.
  </p>
<figure class="figure-like" id="figure-22"><img width="100%" src="images/3773292f0c8831b3ef36257060e3ec94c0790646.png" alt=""><img width="100%" src="images/1f98e827e140667b06ab91a89dea792324374986.png" alt=""></figure><p id="p-1563">
    Once the bijection is understood geometrically it is fairly simple to provide
    formulas. To go from the semi-circle to the interval, we just forget
    about the y-coordinate:
    \begin{equation*}
      f(x, y) = x.
    \end{equation*}
  </p>
<p id="p-1564">
    To go in the other direction we need to recompute the missing y-value:
    \begin{equation*}
      f^{-1}(x) = (x, \sqrt{1 - x^2}).
    \end{equation*}
  </p>
<p id="p-1565">
    Now we're ready to put some of these ideas together in order to prove
    something really quite remarkable. It may be okay to say that line segments
    of different lengths are equinumerous — although ones intuition still balks
    at the idea that a line a mile long only has the same number of points on
    it as a line an inch long (or, if you prefer, make that a centimeter versus
    a kilometer). Would you believe that the entire line — that is the infinitely
    extended line — has no more points on it than a tiny little segment? You
    should be ready to prove this one yourself.

    In the exercises from <a href="sec_equiv_sets.html" alt="Section 8.1 Equivalent sets" title="Section 8.1 Equivalent sets">Section 8.1</a> you were supposed
    to show that set
    equivalence is an equivalence relation. Part of that proof should have been
    showing that the relation is transitive, and that really just comes down to
    showing that the composition of two bijections is itself a bijection. If you
    didn't make it through that exercise give it another try now, but whether
    or not you can finish that proof it should be evident what that transitivity
    means to us in the current situation. Any pair of line segments are the same
    size — a line segment (i.e. an interval) and a semi-circle are the same size — the semi-circle and an infinite line are the same size — transitivity tells us that
    an infinitely extended line has the same number of points as (for example)
    the interval \((0, 1)\).

          It is possible to generalize the argument that shows a line segment is
          equivalent to a line to higher dimensions.   In two dimensions we would
          show that the unit disk (the interior of the unit circle) is equinumerous
          with the entire plane \(\Reals \times \Reals\).   In three dimensions we would show that
          the unit ball (the interior of the unit sphere) is equinumerous with the
          entire space \(\Reals^3 = \Reals \times \Reals \times \Reals\).  Here we

          vertical projection from the unit disk
          in the x–y plane to the upper half of the unit sphere \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1\),
