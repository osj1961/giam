    Proof by exhaustion is the least attractive proof method from
    an aesthetic perspective. An exhaustive proof consists of literally
    (and exhaustively) checking every element of the universe to see
    if the given statement is true for it. Usually, of course, this is
    impossible because the universe of discourse is infinite; but when the
    universe of discourse is finite, one certainly can't argue the validity
    of an exhaustive proof.
  </p>
<p id="p-692">
    In the last few decades the introduction of powerful computational
    assistance for mathematicians has lead to a funny situation. There
    is a growing list of important results that have been “proved” by
    exhaustion using a computer. Important examples of this phenomenon
    are the non-existence of a
    
    projective plane of order 10 <a knowl="./knowl/lam.html" knowl-id="xref-lam" alt="Bibliographic Entry 10 " title="Bibliographic Entry 10 ">[10]</a> and the
    only known value of a
    Ramsey number for hypergraphs <a knowl="./knowl/radz.html" knowl-id="xref-radz" alt="Bibliographic Entry 13 " title="Bibliographic Entry 13 ">[13]</a>.
  </p>
<p id="p-693">
    
    Proof by cases is subtly different from exhaustive proof — for one
    thing a valid proof by cases can be used in an infinite universe.
    In a proof by cases one has to divide the universe of discourse into
    a finite number of sets<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-23" id="fn-23"><span class="footnote"><sup> 1 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-23" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">It is necessary to provide an argument that 
    this list of cases is complete!  I.e. that every element of the universe
    falls into one of the cases.</span></span> and then provide a separate proof for each
    of the cases. A great many statements about the integers can be proved
    using the division of integers into even and odd. Another set of
    cases that is used frequently is the finite number of possible remainders
    obtained when dividing by an integer \(d\). (Note that even and odd correspond
    to the remainders \(0\) and \(1\) obtained after division by \(2\).)
  </p>
<p id="p-694">
    A very famous instance of proof by cases is the computer-assisted proof
    of the
    
    four color theorem. The four color theorem is a result known to
    map makers for quite some time that says that 4 colors are always sufficient
    to color the nations on a map in such a way that countries sharing a boundary
    are always colored differently. <span>&lt;&lt;Unresolved xref, reference "fig_Lux_map"; check spelling or use "provisional" attribute&gt;&gt;</span> shows one instance
    of an arrangement of nations that requires at least four different colors,
    the theorem says that four colors are <!--Style me with CSS--><em>always</em> enough. It should be noted
    that real cartographers usually reserve a fifth color for oceans (and other
    water) and that it is possible to conceive of a map requiring five colors if
    one allows the nations to be non-contiguous. In 1977,
     Kenneth Appel and
    Wolfgang Haken proved the four color
    theorem by reducing the infinitude of possibilities to
    1,936 separate cases and analyzing each of these with a computer.
    The inelegance of a proof by cases is probably proportional to some power of
    the number of cases, but in any case, this proof is generally considered
    somewhat inelegant. Ever since the proof was announced there has been an
    ongoing effort to reduce the number of cases (currently the record is 633
    cases — still far too many to be checked through without a computer) or to
    find a proof that does not rely on cases. For a good introductory article on
    the four color theorem see <a knowl="./knowl/wiki-4color.html" knowl-id="xref-wiki-4color" alt="Bibliographic Entry 6 " title="Bibliographic Entry 6 ">[6]</a>.

    Most exhaustive proofs of statements that aren't trivial tend to either be (literally) too exhausting or to seem rather contrived. One example of a situation
    in which an exhaustive proof of some statement exists is when the statement
    is thought to be universally true but no general proof is known — yet the
    statement has been checked for a large number of cases.
    Goldbach's conjecture
    is one such statement.
    Christian Goldbach  <a knowl="./knowl/wiki-goldbach.html" knowl-id="xref-wiki-goldbach" alt="Bibliographic Entry 4 " title="Bibliographic Entry 4 ">[4]</a>
    was a mathematician born
    in Königsberg Prussia,
    who, curiously, did <!--Style me with CSS--><em>not</em> make the
    conjecture<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-24" id="fn-24"><span class="footnote"><sup> 2 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-24" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">This conjecture was 
    discussed previously in the exercises of <a href="sec_def.html" alt="Section 1.2 Definitions: Prime numbers" title="Section 1.2 Definitions: Prime numbers">Section 1.2</a></span></span> which bears
    his name. In a letter to
    Leonard Euler, Goldbach conjectured that every
    odd number greater than 5 could be expressed as the sum of three primes (nowadays this is known as the
     weak Goldbach conjecture). Euler apparently liked the
    problem and replied to Goldbach stating what is now known as Goldbach's
    conjecture: Every even number greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of
    two primes. This statement has been lying around since 1742, and a great
    many of the world's best mathematicians have made their attempts at proving it — to no avail! (Well, actually a lot of progress has been made but the result
    still hasn't been proved.) It's easy to verify the Goldbach conjecture for
    relatively small even numbers, so what <!--Style me with CSS--><em>has</em> been done is/are proofs by
    exhaustion of Goldbach's conjecture restricted to finite universes.
    As of this writing, the conjecture has been verified to be true of
    all even numbers less than \(2 \times 10^{17}\).

    Whenever an exhaustive proof, or a proof by cases exists for some statement
    it is generally felt that a direct proof would be more esthetically pleasing.

     Graph pebbling is an interesting concept originated
    by the famous combinatorialist  Fan Chung. A “graph”
    (as the term is used here) is a collection
    of places or locations which are known as “nodes,” some of which
    are joined by paths or connections which are known as “edges.”
    Graphs have been studied by mathematicians for about 400 years, and
    many interesting problems can be put in this setting. Graph pebbling
    is a crude version of a broader problem in resource management — often
    a resource actually gets used in the process of transporting it. Think of
    the big tanker trucks that are used to transport gasoline. What do they
    run on? Well, actually they probably burn diesel — but the point is
    that in order to move the fuel around we have to consume some of it.
    Graph pebbling takes this to an extreme: in order to move one pebble
    we must consume one pebble.
  </p>
<p id="p-708">
    Imagine that a bunch of pebbles are randomly
    distributed on the nodes of a graph, and that we are allowed to do
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>graph pebbling moves</em> — we remove two pebbles from some node
    and place a single pebble on a node that is connected to it.

    For any particular graph, we can ask for its <!--Style me with CSS--><em>pebbling number</em>, \(\rho\).
    This is the smallest number so that if \(\rho\) pebbles are distributed <!--Style me with CSS--><em>in any way whatsoever</em> on the nodes of the graph, it will be possible to use
    pebbling moves so as to get a pebble to any node.

<p id="p-710">
    For example, consider the triangle graph — three nodes which are all
    mutually connected. The pebbling number of this graph is 3. If we
    start with one pebble on each node we are already done; if there is a
    node that has two pebbles on it, we can use a pebbling move to reach
    either of the other two nodes.

          Prove that if \(n\) is an odd number then \(n^4 \pmod{16} = 1\).

          \hint{

          While one could perform fairly complicated arithmetic, expanding expression like
          \((16k+13)^4\) and then regrouping to put it in the form \(16q+1\) (and one would need 
          to do that work for each of the odd remainders modulo \(16\)),  that would be missing out
          on the true power of modular notation.  In a “\(\pmod{16}\)” calculation one can simply ignore
          summands like \(16k\) because they are \(0 \pmod{16}\).  Thus, for example,
          \begin{equation*}
            (16k+7)^4 \pmod{16} \; = \; 7^4 \pmod{16} \; = \; 2401 \pmod{16}  \; = \; 1.
          \end{equation*}
          So, essentially one just needs to compute the \(4\)th powers of \(1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13\)  and \(15\), and
          then reduce them modulo 16.  An even greater economy is possible if one notes that (modulo 16) many
          of those cases are negatives of one another — so their \(4\)th powers are equal.

          0 if there are two identical rows (or columns) in the finished array.  Also, if there is a row or column
          that is all zeros, player Zero wins too.  Also, cyclically permuting either rows or columns has no effect
