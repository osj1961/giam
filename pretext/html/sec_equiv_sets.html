    We have seen several interesting examples of equivalence relations
    already, and in this section we will explore one more: we'll say two sets are equivalent
    if they have the same number of elements. Usually, an equivalence relation
    has the effect that it highlights one characteristic of the objects being studied,
    while ignoring all the others. Equivalence of sets brings the issue of size (a.k.a.
    cardinality) into sharp focus while, at the same time, it forgets all about the
    many other features of sets. Sets that are equivalent (under the relation we
    are discussing) are sometimes said to be 
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>equinumerous</em>
    <span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-52" id="fn-52"><span class="footnote"><sup> 1 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-52" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">Perversely, there are also those who use the term <!--Style me with CSS--><em>equipollent</em> 
    to indicate that sets are the same size. This term actually applies to 
    logical statements that are deducible from one another.</span></span>.
  </p>
<p id="p-1546">
  A couple of examples may be in order.

  <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li id="li-484"><p id="p-1547">
        If \(A = \{1, 2, 3\}\) and \(B = \{a, b, c\}\) then \(A\) and \(B\) are equivalent.
      </p></li>
<li id="li-485"><p id="p-1548">
        Since the empty set is unique — \(\emptyset\) is the only set having 0 elements — it
        follows that there are no other sets equivalent to it.
      </p></li>
<li id="li-486"><p id="p-1549">
        Every singleton set<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-53" id="fn-53"><span class="footnote"><sup> 2 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-53" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">Recall that a 
        singleton set is a set having just one element.</span></span> 
        is equivalent to every other singleton set.
      </p></li>
</ul>

    Hopefully these examples are relatively self-evident. Unfortunately, that
    very self-evidence may tend to make you think that this notion of equivalence
    isn't all that interesting — nothing could be further from the truth! The
    notion of equivalence of sets becomes really interesting when we study infinite
    sets. Once we have the right definition in hand we will be able to prove
    some truly amazing results. For instance, the sets \(\Naturals\) and \(\Rationals\) turn out to be equivalent. Since the naturals are wholly contained in the rationals this is (to say the least) counter-intuitive! Coming up with the “right” definition for this concept is crucial.
  </p>
<p id="p-1551">
    We could make the following:
  </p>
<article class="definition-like" id="definition-22"><h5 class="heading">
<span class="type">Definition</span><span class="codenumber">8.1.1</span>
</h5>
<p id="p-1552">
        (Well . . . not quite.) For all sets \(A\) and \(B\), we say \(A\) and \(B\) are
        equivalent, and write \(A \equiv B\) iff \(|A| = |B|\).
      </p></article><p id="p-1553">
    The problem with this definition is that it is circular. We're trying to
    come up with an equivalence relation so that the equivalence classes will
    represent the various cardinalities of sets (i.e. their sizes) and we
    define the relation in terms of cardinalities. We won't get anything new
    from this.
  </p>
<p id="p-1554">
    Georg Cantor was the first person to develop the modern notion of the
    equivalence of sets. His early work used the notion implicitly, but when he
    finally developed the concept of one-to-one correspondences in an explicit
    way he was able to prove some amazing facts. The phrase “one-to-one correspondence”
    has a fairly impressive ring to it, but one can discover what it
    means by just thinking carefully about what it means to count something.
  </p>
<p id="p-1555">
    Consider the solmization syllables used for the notes of the major scale
    in music; they form the set \(\{\mbox{do, re, mi, fa, so, la, ti} \}\).
    What are we doing when
    we count this set (and presumably come up with a total of 7 notes)? We first
    point at `do' while saying `one,' then point at `re' while saying `two,'
    et cetera.
    In a technical sense we are creating a one-to-one correspondence between the
    set containing the seven syllables and the special set \(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}\). You should notice that this one-to-one correspondence is by no means unique. For
    instance we could have counted the syllables in reverse — a descending scale,
    or in some funny order — a little melody using each note once. The fact that
    there are seven syllables in the solmization of the major scale is equivalent
    to saying that there exists a one-to-one correspondence between the syllables
    and the special set \(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}\). Saying “there exists” in this situation may seem a bit weak since in fact there are \(7! = 5040\) correspondences, but “there exists” is what we really want here. What exactly is a one-to-one
    correspondence? Well, we've actually seen such things before — a one-to-one
    correspondence is really just a bijective function between two sets. We're
    finally ready to write a definition that Georg Cantor would approve of.
  </p>
<article class="definition-like" id="definition-23"><h5 class="heading">
<span class="type">Definition</span><span class="codenumber">8.1.2</span>
</h5>
<p id="p-1556">
        For all sets \(A\) and \(B\), we say \(A\) and \(B\) are equivalent, and write
        \(A \equiv B\) iff there exists a one-to-one (and onto) function \(f\), with \(\Dom{f} = A\) and \(\Rng{f} = B\).
      </p></article><p id="p-1557">
    Somewhat more succinctly, one can just say the sets are equivalent iff
    there is a bijection between them.
  </p>
<p id="p-1558">
    We are going to ask you to prove that the above definition defines an
    equivalence relation in the exercises for this section. In order to give you a
    bit of a jump start on that proof we'll outline what the proof that the relation
    is symmetric should look like.
  </p>
<blockquote>
  To show that the relation is symmetric we must assume that \(A\)
  and \(B\) are sets with \(A \equiv B\) and show that this implies that
  \(B \equiv A\). According to the definition above this means that we'll
  need to locate a function (that is one-to-one) from \(B\) to \(A\). On
  the other hand, since it is given that \(A \equiv B\), the definition tells
  us that there actually is an injective function, \(f\), from \(A\) to \(B\).
  The inverse function \(f^{-1}\) would do exactly what we'd like (namely
  form a map from B to A) assuming that we can show that \(f^{-1}\)
  has the right properties. We need to know that \(f^{-1}\) is a function
  (remember that in general the inverse of a function is only a
  relation) and that it is one-to-one. That \(f^{-1}\) is a function is a
  consequence of the fact that \(f\) is one-to-one. That \(f^{-1}\) is one-to-one
  is a consequence of the fact that \(f\) is a function.
  </blockquote>
<p id="p-1559">
    The above is just a sketch of a proof. In the exercise you'll need to fill
    in the rest of the details as well as provide similar arguments for reflexivity
    and transitivity.
  </p>
<p id="p-1560">
    For each possible finite cardinality \(k\), there are many, many sets having
    that cardinality, but there is one set that stands out as the most basic — the
    set of numbers from \(1\) to \(k\). For each cardinality \(k &gt; 0\), we use the symbol
    \(\Naturals_k\) to indicate this set:
    \begin{equation*}
      \Naturals_k \; = \; \{1, 2, 3, \ldots , k\}.
    \end{equation*}
  </p>
<p id="p-1561">
    The finite cardinalities are the equivalence classes (under the relation of
    set equivalence) containing the empty set and the sets \(\Naturals_k\).
    Of course there
    are also infinite sets! The prototype for an infinite set would have to be
    the entire set \(\Naturals\).
    The long-standing tradition is to use the
    symbol 
    \(\aleph_0\)<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-54" id="fn-54"><span class="footnote"><sup> 3 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-54" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">The Hebrew letter (capital) aleph with a 
    subscript zero — usually pronounced “aleph naught.”</span></span>
    for the cardinality
    of sets having the same size as \(\Naturals\), alternatively, such sets
    are known as “countable.” One could make a pretty good argument that
    it is the finite sets that are actually countable! After all it would literally take forever to count the natural numbers! We have to presume that the
    people who instituted
    this terminology meant for “countable” to mean “countable, in principle”
    or “countable if you're willing to let me keep counting forever” or maybe
    “countable if you can keep counting faster and faster and are capable of
    ignoring the speed of light limitations on how fast your lips can move.” Worse
    yet, the term “countable” has come to be used for sets whose cardinalities are
    either finite <!--Style me with CSS--><em>or</em> the size of the naturals. If we want to refer specifically to the infinite sort of countable set most mathematicians
    use the term <!--Style me with CSS--><em>denumerable</em> (although this is not universal) or  <!--Style me with CSS--><em>countably infinite</em>.
    Finally, there are sets
    whose cardinalities are bigger than the naturals. In other words, there are
    sets such that no one-to-one correspondence with \(\Naturals\) is possible.
    We don't mean that people have looked for one-to-one correspondences
    between such sets and \(\Naturals\) and haven't been able to find them — we literally mean that it can't be done; and it is has been proved that it can't be done! Sets having cardinalities that are this ridiculously huge are known as  <!--Style me with CSS--><em>uncountable</em>.
