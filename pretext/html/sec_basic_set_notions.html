    In modern mathematics there is an area called 
    Category theory<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-25" id="fn-25"><span class="footnote"><sup> 1 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-25" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">The classic text by Saunders Mac Lane <a knowl="./knowl/macl.html" knowl-id="xref-macl" alt="Bibliographic Entry 11 " title="Bibliographic Entry 11 ">[11]</a> 
    is still considered one of the best introductions to Category theory.</span></span>
    which studies the
    relationships between different areas of mathematics. More precisely,
    the founders of category theory noticed that essentially the same theorems
    and proofs could be found in many different mathematical fields — with
    only the names of the structures involved changed. In this sort of
    situation one can make what is known as a <!--Style me with CSS--><em>categorical</em> argument
    in which one proves the desired result in the abstract, without reference
    to the details of any particular field. In effect this allows one
    to prove many theorems at once — all you need to convert an abstract
    categorical proof into a concrete one relevant to a particular area
    is a sort of key or lexicon to provide the correct names for things.
    Now, category theory probably shouldn't really be studied until you
    have a background that includes enough different fields that you can
    make sense of their categorical correspondences. Also, there are
    a good many mathematicians who deride category theory as
    “abstract nonsense.” But, as someone interested in developing a facility
    with proofs, you should be on the lookout for categorical correspondences.
    If you ever hear yourself utter something like “well, the proof of
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>that</em> goes just like the proof of the
    (insert weird technical-sounding name here) theorem” you are
    probably noticing a categorical correspondence.
  </p>
<p id="p-762">
    Okay, so category theory won't be of much
    use to you until much later in your mathematical career (if at all), and
    one could argue that it doesn't really save that much effort. Why not just do two or three different
    proofs instead of learning a whole new field so we can combine
    them into one? Nevertheless, category theory is being
    mentioned here at the beginning of the chapter on sets. Why?
  </p>
<p id="p-763">
    We are about to see our first example of a categorical correspondence.
    Logic and Set theory are different aspects of the same thing. To
    describe a set people often quote
     Kurt Gödel — “A set is a Many that allows itself to be thought of as a One.” (Note
    how the attempt at defining what is really an elemental, undefinable
    concept ends up sounding rather mystical.) A more practical approach is
    to think of a set as the collection of things that make some open sentence
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>true</em>.<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-26" id="fn-26"><span class="footnote"><sup> 2 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-26" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">This may sound less metaphysical,
    but this statement is also faulty because it defines “set” in terms of “collection” — which will of course be defined elsewhere as “the sort of things of which sets are one example.”</span></span>
  </p>
<p id="p-764">
    Recall that in Logic the atomic concepts were “true”, “false”,
    “sentence” and “statement.” In Set theory, they are “set”,
    “element” and “membership.” These concepts (more or less) correspond to
    one another. In most books, a set is denoted either using the letter \(M\)
    (which stands for the German word “menge”) or early alphabet capital roman
    letters — \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), <!--Style me with CSS--><em>et cetera</em>. Here, we will often emphasize the connection between
    sets and open sentences in Logic by using a subscript notation. The set that
    corresponds to the open sentence \(P(x)\) will be denoted \(S_P\), we call
    \(S_P\) the  <!--Style me with CSS--><em>truth set</em> of \(P(x)\).
    \begin{equation*}
      S_P = \{ x \suchthat P(x) \}
    \end{equation*}
  </p>
<p id="p-765">
    On the other hand, when we have a set given in the absence of any open
    sentence, we'll be happy to use the early alphabet, capital roman letters
    convention — or frankly, any other letters we feel like!
    Whenever we have a set \(A\) given, it is easy to state a logical
    open sentence that would correspond to it. The membership question: \(M_A(x) =
    \,\) “Is \(x\) in the set \(A\)?” Or, more succinctly,
    \(M_A(x) = \,\) “\(x \in A\)”. Thus the atomic concept “true” from Logic
    corresponds to the answer “yes” to the membership question in Set theory
    (and of course “false” corresponds to “no”).
  </p>
<p id="p-766">
    There are many interesting foundational issues which we are going to
    sidestep in our current development of Set theory. For instance,
    recall that in Logic we always worked inside some
    “universe of discourse.”
    As a consequence of the approach we are taking now, all of our set theoretic
    work will be done within some unknown
    “universal” set. Attempts at
    specifying (<!--Style me with CSS--><em>a priori</em>) a universal set for doing mathematics within
    are doomed to failure. In the early days of the twentieth century
    they attempted to at least get Set theory itself on a firm footing by
    defining the universal set to be “the set of all sets” — an innocuous
    sounding idea that had funny consequences (we'll investigate this in
    <a href="sec_russell.html" alt="Section 4.5 Russell's Paradox" title="Section 4.5 Russell's Paradox">Section 4.5</a>).
  </p>
<p id="p-767">
    In Logic we had “sentences” and “statements,” the latter were
    distinguished as having definite truth values. The corresponding
    thing in Set theory is that sets have the property that we can always
    tell whether a given object is or is not in them. If it ever becomes
    necessary to talk about “sets” where we're not really sure what's in
    them we'll use the term <!--Style me with CSS--><em>collection</em>.
  </p>
<p id="p-768">
    You should think of a set as being an <!--Style me with CSS--><em>unordered</em> collection of
    things, thus \(\{ \mbox{popover} , 1, \mbox{froggy}  \}\) and
    \(\{ 1, \mbox{froggy} , \mbox{popover}  \}\) are two ways to represent the
    same set. Also, a set either contains, or doesn't contain, a given element.
    It doesn't make sense to have an element in a set multiple times. By
    convention, if an element is listed more than once when a set is
    listed we ignore the repetitions. So, the sets
    \(\{ 1, 1\}\) and \(\{1\}\) are really the same thing. If the notion
    of a set containing multiple instances of its elements is needed there
    is a concept known as a
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>multiset</em> that is studied in Combinatorics.
    In a multiset, each element is preceded by a so-called
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>repetition number</em>
    which may be the special symbol \(\infty\) (indicating an unlimited number
    of repetitions). The multiset concept is useful when studying puzzles like
    “How many ways can the letters of MISSISSIPPI be rearranged?” because the
    letters in MISSISSIPPI can be expressed as the multiset \(\{1\cdot M, 4\cdot I,
    2\cdot P, 4\cdot S \}\). With the exception of the following exercise, in the
    remainder of this chapter we will only be concerned with sets, never multisets.

        (Not for the timid!) How many ways can the letters of MISSISSIPPI be arranged?
      </p></article><p id="p-770">
    If a computer scientist were seeking a data structure to implement the
    notion of “set,” he'd want a sorted list where repetitions of an entry
    were somehow disallowed. We've already noted that a set should be thought of
    as an unordered collection, and yet it's been asserted that a <!--Style me with CSS--><em>sorted</em>
    list would be the right vehicle for representing a set on a computer. Why?
    One reason is that we'd like to be able to tell (quickly) whether two sets
    are the same or not. If the elements have been presorted it's easier.
  </p>
<p id="p-771">
    Consider the difficulty in deciding whether the following two sets are
    equal.
    \begin{equation*}
      S_1 = \{ \spadesuit, 1, e, \pi, \diamondsuit, A, \Omega, h, \oplus, \epsilon \}
    \end{equation*}
    \begin{equation*}
      S_2 = \{ A, 1, \epsilon, \pi, e, s, \oplus,  \spadesuit, \Omega, \diamondsuit \}
    \end{equation*}
  </p>
<p id="p-772">
    If instead we compare them after they've been sorted, the job is much easier.
    \begin{equation*}
      S_1 = \{1, A, \diamondsuit, e, \epsilon, h, \Omega, \oplus, \pi, \spadesuit \}
    \end{equation*}
    \begin{equation*}
      S_2 = \{1, A, \diamondsuit, e, \epsilon, \Omega, \oplus, \pi, s, \spadesuit \}
    \end{equation*}
  </p>
<p id="p-773">
    This business about ordered versus unordered comes up fairly often so it's
    worth investing a few moments to figure out how it works. If a collection
    of things that is inherently unordered is handed to us we generally <!--Style me with CSS--><em>put</em>
    them in an order that is pleasing to us. Consider receiving five cards
    from the dealer in a card game, or extracting seven letters from the bag
    in a game of Scrabble. If, on the other hand, we receive
    a collection where order
    is important we certainly <!--Style me with CSS--><em>may not</em> rearrange them. Imagine someone
    receiving the telephone number of an attractive other but writing it down
    with the digits sorted in increasing order!

<article class="exercise-like" id="exercise-41"><h5 class="heading">
<span class="type">Exercise</span><span class="codenumber">4.1.2</span>
</h5>
<p id="p-774">
        Consider a universe consisting of just the first 5 natural numbers
        \(U = \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \}\). How many different sets having 4 elements
        are there in this universe? How many different ordered collections of 4
        elements are there?
      </p></article><p id="p-775">
    The last exercise suggests an interesting question. If you have
    a universal set of some fixed (finite) size, how many different sets
    are there? Obviously you can't have any more elements in a set than
    are in your universe. What's the smallest possible size for a set?
    Many people would answer 1 — which isn't unreasonable! — after all
    a set is supposed to be a collection of things, and is it really possible
    to have a <!--Style me with CSS--><em>collection</em> with nothing in it? The standard answer is
    0 however, mostly because it makes a certain counting formula work out
    nicely. A set with one element is known as a
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>singleton set</em>
    (note the use of the indefinite article). A set with no elements
    is known as the
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>empty set</em> (note the definite article). There
    are as many singletons as there are elements in your universe. They
    aren't the same though, for example \(1 \neq \{ 1 \}\). There is
    only one empty set and it is denoted \(\emptyset\) — irrespective of the
    universe we are working in.
  </p>
<p id="p-776">
    Let's have a look at a small example. Suppose we have a universal set
    with 3 elements, without loss of generality, \(\{1, 2, 3\}\). It's
    possible to construct a set, whose elements are all the possible sets

    One last thing before we end this section. The size (a.k.a. cardinality) of a set is just the number of elements in it. We use the
    very same symbol for cardinality as we do for the absolute value of a
    numerical entity. There should really never be any confusion. If \(A\) is
    a set then \(|A|\) means that we should count how many things are in \(A\).
    If \(A\) isn't a set then we are talking about the ordinary absolute value

        \hint{The power set of a set always includes the empty set as well as the whole set that we
        are forming the power set of.  In this case they happen to coincide so \({\mathcal P}(\emptyset) = \{ \emptyset \}\).  Notice that \(2^0 =1\).}
