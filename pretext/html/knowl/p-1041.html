    Part of the reason that so many people spent so much effort on FLT
    over the centuries is that Fermat had an excellent record as regards
    being correct about his theorems and proofs. The result known as Fermat's
    little theorem is an example of a theorem and proof that Fermat got
    right. It is probably known as his “little” theorem because its
    statement is very short, but it is actually a fairly deep result.
