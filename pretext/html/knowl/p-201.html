    It should be noted that for small numbers one can find the gcd and lcm
    quite easily by considering their factorizations into primes. For the
    moment consider numbers that factor into primes but not into prime
    powers (that is, their factorizations don't involve exponents). The
    gcd is the product of the primes that are in common between these
    factorizations (if there are no primes in common it is 1). The lcm is
    the product of all the distinct primes
    that appear in the factorizations. As an example, consider 30 and 42.
    The factorizations are \(30 = 2\cdot 3\cdot 5\) and \(42 = 2\cdot 3 \cdot
    7\). The primes that are common to both factorizations are \(2\) and
    \(3\), thus \(\gcd{30}{42} = 2\cdot 3 = 6\). The set of all the primes
    that appear in either factorization is \(\{2, 3, 5, 7 \}\) so
    \(\lcm{30}{42} = 2\cdot 3\cdot 5\cdot 7 = 210\).
