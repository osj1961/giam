    Now all of this is a lot of work and it's really much easier
    to notice the form of the answer: The exponent on \(x\) starts at 6 and descends
    with each successive term down to 0. The exponent on \(y\) starts at 0
    and ascends to 6. The coefficients in the answer are the numbers in the
    sixth row of Pascal's triangle.
