    That last example certainly is a doozey! At first glance it would appear
    to have more than three variables in it, and indeed it does! In order of
    appearance, we have \(f\), \(l\), \(c\), \(\epsilon\), \(\delta\) and \(x\) — the
    last three variables that appear (\(\epsilon\), \(\delta\) and \(x\)) are said
    to be <!--Style me with CSS--><em>bound</em>.
    A variable in an open sentence is bound if it is in the
    scope of a quantifier. Bound variables don't need to be mentioned
    in the argument list of the sentence. Unfortunately, when sentences are
    given in natural languages the quantification status of a variable may
    not be clear. For example in the third sentence above, the variable \(\delta\)
    is easily seen to be in the scope of the quantifier \(\exists\) because of the
    words “there is a positive number” that precede it. Similarly, \(\epsilon\)
    is universally quantified (\(\forall\)) because the phrase “for every positive
    number” appears before it. What is the status of \(x\)? Is it really bound?
    The answers to such questions may not be clear at first, but after some
    thought you should be able to decide that \(x\) is universally quantified.
