    There are two notions of being “inside” a set. A thing may be
    an <!--Style me with CSS--><em>element</em> of a set, or may be contained as
    a subset. Distinguishing these two notions of inclusion is essential.
    One difficulty that sometimes complicates things is that a set may contain
    other sets <!--Style me with CSS--><em>as elements</em>. For instance, as we saw in the previous
    section, the elements of a power set are themselves sets.
