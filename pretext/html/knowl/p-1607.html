    This argument that we've been edging towards is known as Cantor's
    diagonalization argument. The reason for this name is that our
    listing of binary representations looks like an enormous table
    of binary digits and the contradiction is deduced by looking at
    the diagonal of this infinite-by-infinite table.
    The diagonal is itself an infinitely long binary string â€” in other words, the
    diagonal can be thought of as a binary expansion itself.
    If we take the complement
    of the diagonal, (switch every 0 to a 1 and vice versa) we will also
    have a thing that can be regarded as a binary expansion and this binary
    expansion can't be one of the ones on the list! This bit-flipped version of
    the diagonal is different from the first binary expansion in the first
    position,
    it is different from the second binary expansion in the second position, it is
    different from the third binary expansion in the third position, and so on.
    The very presumption that we could list all of the elements of \({\mathbb F}_2^\infty\)
    allows us
    to construct an element of \({\mathbb F}_2^\infty\) that could not be on the list!
