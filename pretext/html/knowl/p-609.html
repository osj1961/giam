    In creating a direct proof we need to look at our hypotheses, consider
    the desired conclusion, and develop a strategy for transforming A into B.
    Quite often you'll find it easy to make several deductions from the
    hypotheses, but none of them seems to be headed in the direction of
    the desired conclusion. The usual advice at this stage is
    
    “Try working backwards from the conclusion.”

    in the hopes of meeting somewhere in the middle.</span></span>
