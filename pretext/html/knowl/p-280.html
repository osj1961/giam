    This is a compound sentence made up of the two simpler
    sentences \(P=\) “You finish your peas” and \(D=\) “You'll get dessert.”
    It is an example of a type of compound sentence called a
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>conditional</em>. Conditionals are if-then type statements.
    In ordinary language the word “then” is often elided (as is the case
    with our example above). Another way of phrasing the “If P then D.”
    relationship is to use the word “implies” — although it would be
    a rather uncommon mother who would say “Finishing your peas implies
    that you will receive dessert.”
