    Before we describe these principles in detail,
    we'll have a look at a simpler problem which is most easily described
    by an example: How many integers are there in the list \((7,8,9,\ldots 44)\)?
    We could certainly write down all the integers from \(7\) to \(44\) (inclusive)
    and then count them â€” although this wouldn't be the best plan if the numbers
    \(7\) and \(44\) were replaced with (say) \(7,045,356\) and \(22,355,201\). A method
    that does lead to a generalized ability to count the elements of a finite
    sequence arises if we think carefully about what exactly a finite sequence
