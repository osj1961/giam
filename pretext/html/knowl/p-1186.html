    Before we proceed to the proof that \(\relS\) is an equivalence relation we'd like
    you to be cognizant of a bigger picture as you read. Each of the three parts of
    the proof will have a similar structure. We will show that \(\relS\) has one of the
    three properties by using the fact that \(=\) has that property. In more advanced
    work this entire proof could be omitted or replaced by the phrase “\(\relS\) inherits
    reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity from equality, and is therefore an equivalence
    relation.” (Nice trick isn't it? But before you're allowed to use it you have
    to show that you can do it the hard way …)
