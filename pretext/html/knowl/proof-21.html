      Suppose that \(d\) is the smallest positive number
      in the \(\Integers\)-module \(\{ xa + yb \suchthat x,y \in \Integers \}\).
      There are particular values of \(x\) and \(y\) (which we will distinguish
      with over-lines) such that \(d = \overline{x}a + \overline{y}b\). Now, it
      is easy to see that if \(c\) is any common divisor of \(a\) and \(b\) then
      \(c \divides d\), so what remains to be proved is that \(d\) itself is a divisor
      of both \(a\) and \(b\). Consider dividing \(d\) into \(a\). By the
      division algorithm there are uniquely determined numbers \(q\) and \(r\)
      such that \(a =qd + r\) with \(0 \leq r \lt  d\). We will show that \(r=0\).
      Suppose, to the contrary, that \(r\) is positive. Note that we can
      write \(r\) as \(r = a - qd = a - q(\overline{x}a + \overline{y}b) = (1-q\overline{x})a - q\overline{y}b\). The last equality shows that \(r\) is in the
      \(\Integers\)-module under consideration, and so, since \(d\) is the smallest
      positive integer in this \(\Integers\)-module it follows that \(r \geq d\) which
      contradicts the previously noted fact that \(r \lt  d\). Thus, \(r=0\) and so
      it follows that \(d \divides a\). An entirely analogous argument can be used
      to show that \(d \divides b\) which completes the proof that \(d = \gcd{a}{b}\).
