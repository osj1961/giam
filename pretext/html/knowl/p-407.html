    Now, after all, the beauty of math is supposed to lie in its crystal clarity,
    so this sort of situation is really unacceptable. It may be an impossible
    goal to get “the average Joe” to perform algebraic manipulations with
    clarity, but those of us who aspire to become mathematicians must certainly
    hold ourselves to a higher standard. Two-column proofs are usually what
    is meant by a “higher standard” when we are talking about relatively
    mechanical manipulations — like doing algebra, or more to the point,
    proving logical equivalences. Now don't despair! You will not, in
    a mathematical career, be expected to provide two-column proofs very
    often. In fact, in more advanced work one tends to not give <!--Style me with CSS--><em>any</em> sort
    of proof for a statement that lends itself to a two-column approach. But,
    if you find yourself writing “As the reader can easily verify, Equation 17 holds…” in a paper, or making some similar remark to your students,
    you are <!--Style me with CSS--><em>morally obligated</em> to being able to produce a two-column proof.
