    We often need to first approach
    a topic by thinking visually or intuitively, but when it comes to
    proving our assertions, nothing beats the power of having the
    “right” definitions around. It may be surprising to learn that
    the “right” definition often evolves over the years. This
    happens for the simple reason that some definitions lend themselves
    more easily to proving assertions. In fact, it is often the case
    that definitions are inspired by attempts to prove something that
    fail. In the midst of such a failure, it isn't uncommon for a
    Mathematician to bemoan “If only the definition of (fill in the
    blank) were …”, then to realize that it is possible to
    use that definition or a modification of it. But! When there are
    several definitions
    for the same idea they had better agree with one another!
