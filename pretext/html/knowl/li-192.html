        In constructive dilemma, the antecedent of the conditional 
        sentences are usually chosen to represent opposite alternatives. 
        This allows us to introduce their disjunction as a tautology. 
        Consider the following proof that there is never any reason to worry
        (found on the walls of an Irish pub).
        <blockquote>
        Either you are sick or you are well. 
        If you are well there's nothing to worry about. 
        If you are sick there are just two possibilities: 
        Either you will get better or you will die. 
        If you are going to get better there's nothing to worry about. 
        If you are going to die there are just two possibilities:
        Either you will go to Heaven or to Hell. 
        If you go to Heaven there is nothing to worry about.
        If you go to Hell, you'll be so busy shaking hands with all your friends there won't be time to worry \ldots
        </blockquote>
        Identify the three tautologies that are introduced in this “proof.”

        \hint{Look at the lines that start with the word "Either."}
