    We would be remiss in closing this section without discussing the
    way the sets of numbers we've discussed fit together. Simply put,
    each is contained in the next. \(\Naturals\) is contained in \(\Integers\),
    \(\Integers\) is contained in \(\Rationals\), \(\Rationals\) is contained
    in \(\Reals\), and \(\Reals\) is contained in \(\Complexes\).
    Geometrically the complex numbers are essentially a two-dimensional
    plane. The real numbers sit inside this plane just as the \(x\)-axis
    sits inside the usual Cartesian plane — in this context you may
    hear people talk about “the real line within the complex plane.”
    It is probably clear how \(\Naturals\) lies within \(\Integers\), and
    every integer is certainly a real number. The intermediate set
    \(\Rationals\) (which contains the integers, and is contained by the
    reals) has probably the most interesting relationship with the
    set that contains it. Think of the real line as being solid, like
    a dark pencil stroke. The rationals are like sand that has been
    sprinkled very evenly over that line. Every point on the line
    has bits of sand nearby, but not (necessarily) on top of it.
