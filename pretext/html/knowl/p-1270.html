        The natural logarithm function \(\ln (x)\) is defined by a definite
        integral with the variable \(x\) in the upper limit.
        \begin{equation*}
          \ln (x) = \int_{t=1}^{x} \frac{1}{t} \, \mbox{d} t.
        \end{equation*}
        From this definition we can deduce that \(\ln (x)\) is strictly increasing on its
        entire domain, \((0, \infty)\).  Why is this true?

        We can use the above definition with \(x=2\) to find the value of 
        \(\ln (2) \approx .693\).  We will also take as given the following 
        rule (which is valid for all logarithmic functions).
        \begin{equation*}
          \ln(a^b) = b \ln(a)
        \end{equation*}
        Use the above information to show that there is neither an upper bound 
        nor a lower bound for the values of the natural logarithm.  These facts
        together with the information that \(\ln\) is strictly increasing show that
        \(\Rng{\ln} = \Reals\).
