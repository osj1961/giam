    Negation in Logic corresponds to
    complementation in Set theory. The
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>complement</em> of a set \(A\) is usually denoted by \(\overline{A}\)
    (although some prefer a superscript \(c\) — as in \(A^c\)), this is the set
    of all things that <!--Style me with CSS--><em>aren't</em> in \(A\). In thinking about complementation
    one quickly sees why the importance of working within a well-defined
    universal set is stressed. Consider the set of all math textbooks.
    Obviously the complement of this set would contain texts in English,
    Engineering and Evolution — but that statement is implicitly
    assuming that the universe of discourse is “textbooks.” It's equally
    valid to say that a very long sequence of zeros and ones, a luscious
    red strawberry, and the number \(\sqrt{\pi}\)
    are not math textbooks and so
    these things are all elements of the complement of the set of all math
    textbooks. What is really a concern for us is the issue of whether or not
    the complement of a set is well-defined, that is, can we tell for sure
    whether a given item is or is not in the complement of a set. This
    question is decidable exactly when the membership question for the
    original set is decidable. Many people think that the main
    reason for working within a fixed universal set is that we then
    have well-defined complements. The real reason that we accept
    this restriction is to ensure that both membership criteria,
    \(M_A(x)\) and \(M_{\overline{A}}(x)\), are decidable open sentences.
    As an example of the sort of strangeness that can crop up, consider that
    during the time that I, as the author of this book, was writing the
    last paragraph, this text was nothing more than a very long
    sequence of zeros and ones in the memory of my computer…
