    These three simple tools (and, or &amp; not) are sufficient to
    create extraordinarily complex sentences out of basic components.
    The way these pieces interrelate is a bit reminiscent of algebra,
    in fact the study of these logical operators (or any
    operators that act like them) is called 
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>Boolean Algebra</em><span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-13" id="fn-13"><span class="footnote"><sup> 5 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-13" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">In honor of George Boole, whose 1854 
     book <!--Style me with CSS--><em>An investigation into the Laws of Thought</em> inaugurated the 
     subject.</span></span>. There are distinct differences
    between Boolean and ordinary algebra however. In regular algebra we have
    the binary connectors \(+\) (plus) and \(\cdot\) (times), and the unary
    negation operator \(-\), these are certainly analogous to \(\land\), \(\lor\) &amp;
    \(\lnot\), but there are certain consequences of the fact that multiplication
    is effectively repeated addition that simply don't hold for the Boolean
    operators. For example, there is a well-defined precedence between \(\cdot\) and
    \(+\). In parsing the expression \(4 \cdot 5 + 3\) we all know that the
    multiplication is to be done first. There is no such rule governing
    order of operations between \(\land\) and \(\lor\), so an expression like
    \(A \land B \lor C\) is simply ambiguous — it <!--Style me with CSS--><em>must</em> have parentheses
    inserted in order to show the order, either \((A \land B) \lor C\) or
    \(A \land (B \lor C)\). Another distinction between ordinary and Boolean
    algebra is exponentiation. If there <!--Style me with CSS--><em>were</em> exponents in Boolean algebra,
    we'd need two different kinds — one for repeated conjunction and another
    for repeated disjunction.
