    On the other hand, when we have a set given in the absence of any open
    sentence, we'll be happy to use the early alphabet, capital roman letters
    convention — or frankly, any other letters we feel like!
    Whenever we have a set \(A\) given, it is easy to state a logical
    open sentence that would correspond to it. The membership question: \(M_A(x) =
    \,\) “Is \(x\) in the set \(A\)?” Or, more succinctly,
    \(M_A(x) = \,\) “\(x \in A\)”. Thus the atomic concept “true” from Logic
    corresponds to the answer “yes” to the membership question in Set theory
    (and of course “false” corresponds to “no”).
