    Actually, yes! There is a plane that touches all three spheres tangentially.
    Actually, there are two such planes, one that touches them all on their
    upper surfaces and one that touches them all on their lower surfaces. Oh
    damn! There are actually <!--Style me with CSS--><em>lots</em> of planes that are tangent to all three spheres
    but only one that lies above the three of them. That plane intersects the
    plane \(z=0\) in a line â€” nothing fancy there; any pair of non-parallel planes
    will intersect in a line (and the only way the planes we are discussing
    would be parallel is if all three spheres just happened to be the same size).
    But that plane also lies tangent to the cones that envelope our spheres
    and so that plane (as well as the plane \(z=0\)) contains the tips of the
    cones!
