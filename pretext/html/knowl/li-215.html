          The Buley Library is very tall.

          Therefore, either the Buley Library is very tall or it has many
          levels underground.

          The grass is green.

          The sky is blue.

          Therefore, the grass is green and the sky is blue.

          \(g\) has order 3 or it has order 4.

          If \(g\) has order 3, then \(g\) has an inverse.

          If \(g\) has order 4, then \(g\) has an inverse.

          Therefore, \(g\) has an inverse.

          \(x\) is greater than 5 and \(x\) is less than 53.

          Therefore, \(x\) is less than 53.

          If \(a|b\), then \(a\) is a perfect square.

          If \(a|b\), then \(b\) is a perfect square.

          Therefore, if \(a|b\), then \(a\) is a perfect square and \(b\) is
          a perfect square.

          \hint{Note that the conclusion could be re-expressed as the conjunction of the two conditionals that
          are found in the premises.  This is conjunctive addition with a bit of “window dressing.”}
