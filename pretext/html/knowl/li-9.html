        The “see and say” sequence is produced by first writing a 1, 
        then iterating the following procedure:  look at the previous entry 
        and say how many entries there are of each integer and write down what 
        you just said.  The first several terms of the “see and say” sequence 
        are \(1, 11, 21, 1112, 3112, 211213, 312213, 212223, \ldots\).  Comment on the
        rationality (or irrationality) of the number whose decimal digits are obtained 
        by concatenating the “see and say” sequence.
        \begin{equation*}
          0.1112111123112211213...
        \end{equation*}

        Experiment!

        What would it mean for this number to be rational?  If we were to
        run into an element of the “see and say” sequence that is its own description, then
        from that point onward the sequence would get stuck repeating the same thing over and over
        (and the number whose digits are found by concatenating the elements of the “see and say” 
        sequence will enter into a repeating pattern.)
