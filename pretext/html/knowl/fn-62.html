</h5>In Geometry, two objects are said to be <!--Style me with CSS--><em>similar</em> 
    if one can be made to exactly coincide with the other after a series of 
    rigid translations, rotations and scalings.  In other words, they have 
    the same shape if you allow for differences in scale and are allowed to 
    slide them around and spin them about as needed.</span><span class="incontext"><a href="section-44.html#fn-62">in-context</a></span>
