    We have gotten relatively used to relations “on” a set, but recall
    that the more general situation is that a binary relation is
    a subset of \(A \times B\). In this setting, if the relation is
    actually a function \(f\), we say that \(f\) is a function <!--Style me with CSS--><em>from</em> \(A\emph{to}B\). Now, quite often there are input values that simply don't
    work for a given function (for instance the well-known “you can't take
    the square root of a negative” rule). Also, it is often the case that
    certain outputs just can't happen. So, when dealing with a function
    as a relation contained in \(A \times B\) there are actually four sets
    that are of interest — the sets \(A\) and \(B\) (of course) but also some
    sets that we'll denote by \(A'\) and \(B'\). The set \(A'\) consists of those
    elements of \(A\) that actually appear as the first coordinate of a pair
    in the relation \(f\). The set \(B'\) consists of those elements of \(B\)
    that actually appear as the second coordinate of a pair in the relation \(f\).
    A generic example of how these four sets might look is given in <a knowl="./knowl/fig_generic_function.html" knowl-id="xref-fig_generic_function" alt="Figure 6.4.3 " title="Figure 6.4.3 ">Figure 6.4.3</a>.
