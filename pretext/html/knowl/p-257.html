    As usual, mathematicians have developed an incredibly terse, compact
    notation for these ideas.<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-12" id="fn-12"><span class="footnote"><sup> 4 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-12" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">One begins to suspect that

    First, we represent an
    entire sentence by a single letter — traditionally, a capital letter.
    This is called a <!--Style me with CSS--><em>predicate variable</em>.
    For example, following the example above, we could denote the sentence
    “The sun is shining” by the letter \(S\). Similarly, we could make the
    assignment \(R =\) “It is raining.” The conjunction and disjunction
    of these sentences can then be represented using the symbols \(S \land R\)
    and \(S \lor R\), respectively. As a mnemonic, note that the connective
    in \(S \land R\) looks very much like the capital letter A (as in And).
