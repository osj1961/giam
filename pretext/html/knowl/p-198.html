    Before we move on to describe the Euclidean algorithm it might be
    useful to describe more explicitly what exactly it's <!--Style me with CSS--><em>for</em>.
    Given a pair of integers, \(a\) and \(b\), there are two quantities that
    it is important to be able to compute, the 
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>least common multiple</em>
    or lcm, and the 
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>greatest common divisor</em> or gcd. The lcm also
    goes by the name <!--Style me with CSS--><em>lowest common denominator</em> because it is the
    smallest denominator that could be used as a common denominator in the
    process of adding two fractions that had \(a\) and \(b\) in their
    denominators. The gcd and the lcm are related by the formula
    \begin{equation*}
      \lcm{a}{b} = \frac{ab}{\gcd{a}{b}},
    \end{equation*}
    so they are essentially equivalent as far as representing a
    computational challenge.
