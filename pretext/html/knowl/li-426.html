        Georg Cantor developed a systematic way of listing the rational numbers.
        By “listing” a set one is actually developing a bijection from \(\Naturals\) to
        that set.  The method known as “Cantor's Snake” creates a bijection from
        the naturals to the non-negative rationals.  
        First we create an infinite table whose rows
        are indexed by positive integers and whose columns are indexed by non-negative
        integers — the entries in this table are rational numbers of the form
        “column index” / “row index.”  We then follow a snake-like path that
        zig-zags across this table — whenever we encounter a rational number that 
        we haven't seen before (in lower terms) we write it down.  This is indicated 
        in the diagram below by circling the entries.

        Effectively this gives us a function \(f\) which produces the rational number 
        that would be found in a given position in this list.  For example 
        \(f(1) = 0/1, f(2) = 1/1\) and \(f(5) = 1/3\).  

        What is \(f(26)\)?  What is \(f(30)\)?  What is \(f^{-1}(3/4)\)? What is \(f^{-1}(6/7)\)?
