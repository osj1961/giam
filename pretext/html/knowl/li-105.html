          A function \(f(x)\) is said to be  
          <!--Style me with CSS--><em>invertible</em> if there is another function \(g(x)\) such that 
          \(g(f(x)) = x\) for all values of \(x\).  (Usually, the inverse function,
          \(g(x)\) would be denoted \(f^{-1}(x)\).)   Suppose a function is presented 
          to you as a relation â€” that is, you are just given a set of pairs.  
          How can you distinguish whether the function represented by this list 
          of input/output pairs is invertible?  How can you produce the inverse 
          (as a set of ordered pairs)?
 
          \hint{If \(f\) sends \(x\) to \(y\), then we want \(f^{-1}\) to send \(y\) back to \(x\).  So the inverse just has the pairs in \(f\) reversed.  When is the inverse going to fail to be a function?}
