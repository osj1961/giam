        Use the second definition of “prime” to see that \(6\) is
        not a prime.  In other words, find two numbers (the \(a\) and \(b\) 
        that appear in the definition) such that \(6\) is not a factor of
        either, but <!--Style me with CSS--><em>is</em> a factor of their product.



        \hint{Well, we know that 6 really isn't a prime... Maybe its factors enter into this somehow…}
