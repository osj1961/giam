      Suppose there is an elevator with a capacity of 1300 pounds. A large
      group of men who all weigh about 200 pounds want to ascend in it. How
      many should ride at a time? This is just a division problem, 1300/200
      gives 6.5 men should ride together. Well, obviously putting half a
      person on an elevator is a bad idea â€” should we just round-up and
      let 7 ride together? Not if the 1300 pound capacity rating doesn't
      have a safety margin! This is an example of the kind of problem
      in which the floor function is used. The 
      floor function takes a real number as input and returns the next
      lower integer.
