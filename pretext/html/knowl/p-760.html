    There are many interesting foundational issues which we are going to
    sidestep in our current development of Set theory. For instance,
    recall that in Logic we always worked inside some
    “universe of discourse.”
    As a consequence of the approach we are taking now, all of our set theoretic
    work will be done within some unknown
    “universal” set. Attempts at
    specifying (<!--Style me with CSS--><em>a priori</em>) a universal set for doing mathematics within
    are doomed to failure. In the early days of the twentieth century
    they attempted to at least get Set theory itself on a firm footing by
    defining the universal set to be “the set of all sets” — an innocuous
    sounding idea that had funny consequences (we'll investigate this in
    <a href="sec_russell.html" alt="Section 4.5 Russell's Paradox" title="Section 4.5 Russell's Paradox">Section 4.5</a>).
