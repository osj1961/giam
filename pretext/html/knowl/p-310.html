        What are the converse and inverse of “If you watch my back, I'll 
        watch your back.”?



        \hint{
        The converse is “If I watch your back, then you'll watch my back.”  (Sounds a little dopey doesn't it — likes its sort of a wishful thinking…)
        The inverse is “If you don't watch my back, then I won't watch your back.”  (Sounds less vapid, but it means the same thing…)
        }
