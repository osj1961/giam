      Let \(n = |A|\) and proceed by induction on \(n\).
    </p>
<p>
      <!--Style me with CSS--><em>Basis:</em> Suppose \(A\) is a finite set and \(|A| = 0\), it follows
      that \(A = \emptyset\). The power set of \(\emptyset\) is \(\{ \emptyset \}\)
      which is a set having 1 element. Note that \(2^0 = 1\).
    </p>
<p>
      <!--Style me with CSS--><em>Inductive step:</em> Suppose that \(A\) is a finite set with \(|A| = k+1\). Choose some particular element of \(A\), say \(a\), and note that
      we can divide the subsets of \(A\) (i.e. elements of \({\mathcal P}(A)\)) into
      two categories, those that contain \(a\) and those that don't.
    </p>
<p>
      Let \(S_1 = \{ X \in {\mathcal P}(A) \suchthat a \in X \}\) and let
      \(S_2 = \{ X \in {\mathcal P}(A) \suchthat a \notin X \}\). We have
      created two sets that contain all the elements of \({\mathcal P}(A)\),
      and which are disjoint from one another. In symbolic form,
      \(S_1 \cup S_2 = {\mathcal P}(A)\) and \(S_1 \cap S_2 = \emptyset\).
      It follows that \(|{\mathcal P}(A)| = |S_1| + |S_2|\).
    </p>
<p>
      Notice that \(S_2\) is actually the power set of the \(k\)-element set
      \(A \setminus \{ a \}\). By the inductive hypothesis, \(|S_2| = 2^k\).
      Also, notice that each set in \(S_1\) corresponds uniquely to a set in
      \(S_2\) if we just remove the element \(a\) from it. This shows that
      \(|S_1| = |S_2|\). Putting this all together we get that
      \(|{\mathcal P}(A)| = 2^k + 2^k = 2(2^k) = 2^{k+1}\).
