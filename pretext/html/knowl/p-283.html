<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>
    A conditional statement's components are called the
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>antecedent</em>
    (this is the “if” part, as in “finish
    your peas”) and the <!--Style me with CSS--><em>consequent</em> (this is the “then” part, as in
    “get dessert”). The discussion in the
    last paragraph was intended to make the point that when the antecedent
    is false, we should consider the conditional to be true. Conditionals
    that are true because their antecedents are false are said to
    be <!--Style me with CSS--><em>vacuously true</em>. The conditional
    involving an antecedent \(A\)
    and a consequent \(B\) is expressed symbolically using an arrow:
    \(A \implies B\). Here is a truth table for this connective.
