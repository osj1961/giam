    For each of the following arguments, write it in symbolic form and determine 
    which rules of inference are used.

          You are either with us, or you're against us.  And you don't appear to be with us.
          So, that means you're against us!

          This is “disjunctive syllogism.”

          All those who had cars escaped the flooding.  Sandra had a car — therefore, Sandra
          escaped the flooding.

          \hint{
          Let \(C(x)\) be the open sentence “x has a car” and let \(E(x)\) be the open sentence “x escaped the flooding.”
          This argument is actually the particular form of universal modus ponens: (See the final question in the next set of exercises.)
          <table>

<td class="l m b0 r0 l0 t0 lines">\(\forall x, C(x) \implies E(x)\)</td>

          At this stage in the game it would be perfectly fine to just identify this as modus ponens and not worry about the quantifiers that appear.

          (A non-constructive proof that there are 
          irrational numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a^b\) is rational.)  
          Either \(\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}\) is rational or it is irrational.
          If \(\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}\) is rational, we let \(a=b=\sqrt{2}\).
          Otherwise, we let \(a=\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}\) and \(b=\sqrt{2}\).
          (Since \(\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}} = 2\), which is rational.) It follows that in either case, there
          are irrational numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a^b\) is rational.
