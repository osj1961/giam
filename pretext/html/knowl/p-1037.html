    There is a very famous result known as
    Fermat's Little Theorem.
    This would probably be abbreviated FLT except for two things.
    In science fiction FLT means “faster than light travel” and
    there is <!--Style me with CSS--><em>another</em> theorem due to Fermat that goes by
    the initials FLT: Fermat's Last Theorem.
    Fermat's last theorem states that equations of the form \(a^n+b^n=c^n\),
    where \(n\) is a positive natural number,
    only have integer solutions that are trivial (like \(0^3+1^3=1^3\)) when \(n\)
    is greater than 2. When \(n\) is 1, there are lots of integer solutions.
    When \(n\) is 2, there are still plenty of integer solutions — these are the
    so-called Pythagorean triples, for example 3,4 &amp; 5 or 5,12 &amp; 13.
    It is somewhat unfair that this statement is known as Fermat's last <!--Style me with CSS--><em>theorem</em> since he didn't prove it (or at least we can't be sure that he proved it).
    Five years after his death, Fermat's son published a translated<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-35" id="fn-35"><span class="footnote"><sup> 1 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-35" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">The
    translation from Greek into Latin was done by Claude Bachet.</span></span> version of
    Diophantus's <!--Style me with CSS--><em>Arithmetica</em> containing his father's notations. One of
    those notations — near the place where Diophantus was discussing the
    equation \(x^2+y^2=z^2\) and its solution in whole numbers — was the statement
    of what is now known as Fermat's last theorem as well as the following claim:
