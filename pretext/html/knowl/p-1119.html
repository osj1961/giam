    In this definition, \(b\) is the “intermediate result,” if there is no such
    \(b\) that serves to connect \(a\) to \(c\) then \((a,c)\) won't be in the composite.
    Also, notice that this is the composition \(\relR\) first, then \(\relS\), but
    it is written as \(\relS \circ \relR\) — watch out for this! The
    compositions of relations should be read from right to left. This convention
    makes sense when you consider functional composition, \(f(g(x))\) means \(g\)
    first, then \(f\) so if we use the “little circle” notation for the
    composition of relations we have \(f \circ g (x) = f(g(x))\) which is nice
    because the symbols \(f\) and \(g\) appear in the same order. But beware! there
    are atavists out there who write their compositions the other way around.
