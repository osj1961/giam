    Sources differ, but it is not clear whether Morley ever proved his
    theorem. The first valid proof (according to R. K. Guy in  <a knowl="./knowl/lighthouse.html" knowl-id="xref-lighthouse" alt="Bibliographic Entry 8 " title="Bibliographic Entry 8 ">[8]</a>
    was published in 1909 by M. Satyanarayana  <a knowl="./knowl/satyana.html" knowl-id="xref-satyana" alt="Bibliographic Entry 15 " title="Bibliographic Entry 15 ">[15]</a>. There are now
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>many</em> other proofs known, for instance the cut-the-knot website
    (<tt class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">http://www.cut-the-knot.org/</tt>) exposits no less than nine different
    proofs. The proof by Satyanarayana used trigonometry. The proof we'll
    look at here is arguably the shortest ever produced and it is due to
    John Conway. It is definitely a “Book proof”!
