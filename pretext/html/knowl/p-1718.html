    For a set consisting of just a single
    checker positioned at \((0,5)\) the value of our invariant is 1.
    On the other hand, the set consisting of the entire army lined
    up on and below the \(x\)-axis also yields a 1. Every checker move either
    does not change the value of the invariant or reduces it. The best
    we could possibly hope for is that there would be no need for moves
    of the sort that reduce
    the invariant â€” nevertheless we still could not get a man to \((0,5)\)
    in a finite number of moves.
