    This is another of those defining properties that is designed so
    that when it is true it is vacuously true. An injective function
    never takes two distinct inputs to the same output. Perhaps the
    cleanest way to think about injective functions is in terms of
    preimages — when a function is injective, preimages are unique.
    Actually, this is a good time to mention something about surjective
    functions and preimages — if a function is surjective, every element
    of the codomain <!--Style me with CSS--><em>has</em> a preimage. So, if a function has both
    of these properties it means that every element of the codomain
    has one (and only one) preimage.
