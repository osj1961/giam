    Georg Cantor was the first person to develop the modern notion of the
    equivalence of sets. His early work used the notion implicitly, but when he
    finally developed the concept of one-to-one correspondences in an explicit
    way he was able to prove some amazing facts. The phrase “one-to-one correspondence”
    has a fairly impressive ring to it, but one can discover what it
    means by just thinking carefully about what it means to count something.
