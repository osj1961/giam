      Suppose that \(x\) is an arbitrary element of \(D\). From the definition
      of \(D\) it follows that there is an integer \(k\) such that \(x=9k\).
      We want to show that \(x \in C\), but since \(x=9k\) it is easy to
      see that \(x = 3(3k)\) which shows (since \(3k\) is clearly an integer)
      that \(x\) is in \(C\).
