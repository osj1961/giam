    In modern mathematics there is an area called 
    Category theory<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-25" id="fn-25"><span class="footnote"><sup> 1 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-25" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">The classic text by Saunders Mac Lane <a knowl="./knowl/macl.html" knowl-id="xref-macl" alt="Bibliographic Entry 11 " title="Bibliographic Entry 11 ">[11]</a> 
    is still considered one of the best introductions to Category theory.</span></span>
    which studies the
    relationships between different areas of mathematics. More precisely,
    the founders of category theory noticed that essentially the same theorems
    and proofs could be found in many different mathematical fields — with
    only the names of the structures involved changed. In this sort of
    situation one can make what is known as a <!--Style me with CSS--><em>categorical</em> argument
    in which one proves the desired result in the abstract, without reference
    to the details of any particular field. In effect this allows one
    to prove many theorems at once — all you need to convert an abstract
    categorical proof into a concrete one relevant to a particular area
    is a sort of key or lexicon to provide the correct names for things.
    Now, category theory probably shouldn't really be studied until you
    have a background that includes enough different fields that you can
    make sense of their categorical correspondences. Also, there are
    a good many mathematicians who deride category theory as
    “abstract nonsense.” But, as someone interested in developing a facility
    with proofs, you should be on the lookout for categorical correspondences.
    If you ever hear yourself utter something like “well, the proof of
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>that</em> goes just like the proof of the
    (insert weird technical-sounding name here) theorem” you are
    probably noticing a categorical correspondence.
