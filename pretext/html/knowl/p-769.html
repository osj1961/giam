    The last exercise suggests an interesting question. If you have
    a universal set of some fixed (finite) size, how many different sets
    are there? Obviously you can't have any more elements in a set than
    are in your universe. What's the smallest possible size for a set?
    Many people would answer 1 — which isn't unreasonable! — after all
    a set is supposed to be a collection of things, and is it really possible
    to have a <!--Style me with CSS--><em>collection</em> with nothing in it? The standard answer is
    0 however, mostly because it makes a certain counting formula work out
    nicely. A set with one element is known as a
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>singleton set</em>
    (note the use of the indefinite article). A set with no elements
    is known as the
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>empty set</em> (note the definite article). There
    are as many singletons as there are elements in your universe. They
    aren't the same though, for example \(1 \neq \{ 1 \}\). There is
    only one empty set and it is denoted \(\emptyset\) — irrespective of the
    universe we are working in.
