    The  Euclidean algorithm depends
    on a rather extraordinary property of
    the gcd. Suppose that we are trying to compute \(\gcd{a}{b}\) and that
    \(a\) is the larger of the two numbers. We first feed \(a\) and \(b\) into
    the division algorithm to find \(q\) and \(r\) such that \(a = qb +r\). It
    turns out that \(b\) and \(r\) have the <!--Style me with CSS--><em>same</em> gcd as did \(a\) and
    \(b\). In other words, \(\gcd{a}{b} = \gcd{b}{r}\), furthermore these
    numbers are smaller than the ones we started with! This is nice
    because it means we're now dealing with an easier version of the same
    problem. In designing an algorithm it is important to formulate a
    clear <!--Style me with CSS--><em>ending criterion</em>, a condition that tells you you're done.
    In the case of the Euclidean algorithm, we know we're done when the
    remainder \(r\) comes out \(0\).
