    The technique just described is of little value for numbers having more
    than about 50 decimal digits because it rests <!--Style me with CSS--><em>a priori</em> on the
    ability to find the prime factorizations of the numbers involved.
    Factoring numbers is easy enough if they're reasonably small,
    especially if some of their prime factors are small, but in general
    the problem is considered so difficult that many cryptographic schemes
    are based on it.
