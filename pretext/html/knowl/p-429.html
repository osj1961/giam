    Consider the sentence “There are exactly 7 odd primes less than 20.”
    This sentence has some kind of ambiguity in it (because it doesn't mention
    the primes explicitly) and yet it certainly seems to have a definite
    truth value! The reason its truth value is known (by the way, it is T)
    is that the sentence is quantified. “X is an odd prime less than 20.”
    is an ambiguous sentence, but “There are exactly 7 distinct X's that
    are odd primes less than 20.” is not. This example represents a fairly
    unusual form of quantification. Usually, we take away the ambiguity
    of a sentence having a variable in it by asserting one of two levels
    of quantification: “this is true at least once” or “this is always true”.
    We've actually seen the symbols (\(\exists\) and \(\forall\)) for these
    concepts already (in <a href="sec_scary.html" alt="Section 1.3 More scary notation" title="Section 1.3 More scary notation">Section 1.3</a>).
