          The proof that \(\sqrt{2}\) is irrational can be generalized 
          to show that \(\sqrt{p}\) is irrational for every prime number \(p\).
          What statement would be equivalent to the lemma about the parity
          of \(x\) and \(x^2\) in such a generalization?



          \hint{Hint: Saying “x is even” is the same thing as saying “x is evenly divisible by 2.”  Replace the \(2\) by \(p\) and you're halfway there…}
