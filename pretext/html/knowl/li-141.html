    Find the negation of each of the following and simplify as much as possible.

    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li id="li-142"><p id="p-350">
          \((A \lor B) \; \iff \; C\)
        </p></li>
<li id="li-143"><p id="p-351">
          \((A \lor B) \; \implies \; (A \land B)\)
        </p></li>
</ol>
    </p>

    \hint{Neither of these is particularly amenable to simplification. Nor, perhaps, is it readily
    apparent what “simplify” means in this context! My interpretation is that we should look
    for a logically equivalent expression using the fewest number of operators and if possible
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>not</em> using the more complicated operators (\(\implies\) and \(\iff\)).  However, if we try 
    to rewrite the first statement's negation using only \(\land\), \(\lor\) and \(\lnot\) we get things
    that look a lot more complicated than \((A \lor B) \; \iff \; {\lnot}C\)— the quick way to negate a 
    biconditional is simply to negate one of its parts.

    The second statement's negation turns out to be the same thing as exclusive or, so a particularly
    simple response would be to write \(A \oplus B\) although that feels a bit like cheating, so
    maybe we should answer with \((A \lor B) \land {\lnot}(A \land B)\)— but that answer is what we
    would get by simply applying the rule for negating a conditional and doing no further simplification.
