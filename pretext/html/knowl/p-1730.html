    The main idea is simply to move to 3-dimensional space. Imagine the
    original flat plane containing our three random circles as being the
    plane \(z=0\) in Euclidean 3-space. Replace the three circles by three
    spheres of the same radius and having the same centers — clearly the
    intersections of these spheres with the plane \(z=0\) will be our original
    circles. While pairs of circles are encompassed by two lines (the external
    tangents that we've been discussing so much), when we have a pair of spheres
    in 3-space, they are encompassed by a cone which lies tangent to both
    spheres<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-64" id="fn-64"><span class="footnote"><sup> 2 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-64" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">As before, when the spheres happen to have identical radii 
    we get a degenerate case — the cone becomes a cylinder.</span></span>. Notice that
    the cones that lie tangent to a pair of spheres intersect the plane
    precisely in those infamous external tangents.
