    You may have noticed that in <a href="sec_basic.html" alt="Section 1.1 Basic sets" title="Section 1.1 Basic sets">Section 1.1</a> an awful lot of
    emphasis was placed on whether we had good, precise definitions
    for things. Indeed, more than once apologies were made for giving
    imprecise or intuitive definitions. This is because, in Mathematics,
    definitions are our lifeblood. More than in any other human
    endeavor, Mathematicians strive for precision. This precision
    comes with a cost — Mathematics can deal with only the very
    simplest of phenomena<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-4" id="fn-4"><span class="footnote"><sup> 1 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-4" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">For an intriguing discussion of this 
    point, read Gian Carlo Rota's book <!--Style me with CSS--><em>Indiscrete Thoughts</em>  <a knowl="./knowl/rota.html" knowl-id="xref-rota" alt="Bibliographic Entry 14 " title="Bibliographic Entry 14 ">[14]</a>.</span></span>.
    To laypeople who think of math as being
    a horribly difficult subject, that last sentence will certainly
    sound odd, but most professional Mathematicians will be nodding
    their heads at this point. Hard questions are more properly dealt
    with by Philosophers than by Mathematicians. Does a cat have
    a soul? Impossible
    to say, because neither of the nouns in that question can be
    defined with any precision. Is the square root of 2 a rational number?
    Absolutely not! The reason
    for the certainty we feel in answering this second question is
    that we know <!--Style me with CSS--><em>precisely</em> what is meant by the phrases
    “square root of 2” and “rational number.”
