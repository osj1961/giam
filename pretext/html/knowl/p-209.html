    So what was the problem after all? Essentially this: there are
    many expressions formed with one integer written above another (with an
    intervening fraction bar) that represent the exact same rational
    number. For example \(\frac{3}{6}\) and \(\frac{14}{28}\) are distinct
    things that appear in the set defined above, but we all know that they
    both represent the rational number \(\frac{1}{2}\). To eliminate this
    problem with our definition of the rationals we need to add an
    additional condition that ensures that such duplicates don't arise.
    It turns out that what we want is for the numerators and denominators
    of our fractions to have <!--Style me with CSS--><em>no</em> factors in common. Another way to
    say this is that the \(a\) and \(b\) from the definition above should be
    chosen so that \(\gcd{a}{b} = 1\). A pair of numbers whose gcd is 1 are
    called  <!--Style me with CSS--><em>relatively prime</em>.
