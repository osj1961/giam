    The strong form of mathematical induction (a.k.a. the principle of
    complete induction, PCI; also a.k.a. course-of-values induction)
    is so-called because the hypotheses one
    uses are stronger. Instead of showing that \(P_k \implies P_{k+1}\) in
    the inductive step, we get to assume that all the statements numbered
    smaller than \(P_{k+1}\) are true. To make life slightly easier we'll
    renumber things a little. The statement that needs to be proved is
    \begin{equation*}
      \forall k (P_0 \land P_1 \land \ldots \land  P_{k-1}) \implies P_k.
    \end{equation*}
