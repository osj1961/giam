          There is a graph known as \(K_4\) that has \(4\) nodes and there is an edge between every pair of nodes.
          The pebbling number of \(K_4\) has to be at least \(4\) since it would be possible to put one pebble on each of
          \(3\) nodes and not be able to reach the remaining node using pebbling moves.  Show that the pebbling number of \(K_4\) is actually \(4\).

          \hint{If there are two pebbles on any node we will be able to reach all the other nodes using pebbling moves
          (since every pair of nodes is connected).}
