<p>
          We proceed by induction on \(n\).

          <!--Style me with CSS--><em>Basis: </em> Suppose \(H\) is a set containing 1 horse. Clearly
          this horse is the same color as itself.
        </p>
<p>
          <!--Style me with CSS--><em>Inductive step: </em> Given a set of \(k+1\) horses \(H\) we can
          construct two sets of \(k\) horses. Suppose \(H = \{ h_1, h_2, h_3, \ldots h_{k+1} \}\). Define \(H_a = \{ h_1, h_2, h_3, \ldots h_{k} \}\) (i.e. \(H_a\) contains
          just the first \(k\) horses) and \(H_b = \{ h_2, h_3, h_4, \ldots h_{k+1} \}\)
          (i.e. \(H_b\) contains the last \(k\) horses). By the inductive hypothesis
          both these sets contain horses that are “all the same color.” Also,
          all the horses from \(h_2\) to \(h_k\) are in both sets so both \(H_a\) and
          \(H_b\) contain only horses of this (same) color. Finally, we conclude that
          all the horses in \(H\) are the same color.
