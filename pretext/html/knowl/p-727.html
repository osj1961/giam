    Many existential proofs involve a property of the natural numbers
    known as the well-ordering principle. The well-ordering principle is
    sometimes abbreviated WOP. If a set has WOP it doesn't mean that the
    set is ordered in a particularly good way, but rather that its subsets
    are like wells — the kind one hoists water out of with a bucket on a rope.
    You needn't be concerned with WOP in general at this point, but notice
    that the subsets of the natural numbers have a particularly nice property — any non-empty set of natural numbers must have a least element (much like
    every water well has a bottom).
