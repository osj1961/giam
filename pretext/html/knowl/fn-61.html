</h5>Duplicating the cube 
    is also known as the Delian problem — the problem comes from a pronouncement
    by the oracle of Apollo at Delos that a plague afflicting the Athenians would
    be lifted if they built an altar to Apollo that was twice as big as the 
    existing altar.  The existing altar was a cube, one meter on a side, so they
    carefully built a two meter cube — but the plague raged on.  Apparently what
    Apollo wanted was a cube that had double the <!--Style me with CSS--><em>volume</em> of the 
    present altar — it's side length would have to be 
    \(\sqrt[3]{2} \approx 1.25992\) and since this was Greece and it was around 
    430 B.C. and there were no electronic calculators, they were basically
    just screwed.</span><span class="incontext"><a href="section-44.html#fn-61">in-context</a></span>
