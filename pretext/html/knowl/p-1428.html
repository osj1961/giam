    Another perfectly lovely argument involving parity arises in questions
    concerning whether or not it is possible to tile a pruned chessboard
    with dominoes. We've seen dominoes before in <a href="sec_induct.html" alt="Section 5.1 The principle of mathematical induction" title="Section 5.1 The principle of mathematical induction">Section 5.1</a>
    and we're just hoping you've run across chessboards before. Usually
    a chessboard is 8 × 8, but we would like to adopt a more
    liberal interpretation that a chessboard can be any rectangular grid
    of squares we might choose.<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-49" id="fn-49"><span class="footnote"><sup> 3 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-49" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">The game known as “draughts” in the
    UK and “checkers” in the US is played on an \(8 \times 8\) board, but 
    (for example) international draughts is played on a \(10 \times 10\) 
    board and Canadian checkers is played on a \(12 \times 12\) board.</span></span>
    Suppose that we have a supply of dominoes that are of just the right
    size that if they are laid on a chessboard they perfectly cover two
    adjacent squares. Our first question is quite simple. Is it possible
    to perfectly tile an \(m \times n\) chessboard with such dominoes?
