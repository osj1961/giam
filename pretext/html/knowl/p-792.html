    Another perspective that may help clear up the distinction between
    \(\in\) and \(\subseteq\) is to consider what they correspond to in Logic.
    The “element of” symbol \(\in\) is used to construct open sentences
    that embody the membership question — thus it corresponds to single
    sentences in Logic. The “set containment” symbol \(\subseteq\) goes
    between two <!--Style me with CSS--><em>sets</em> and so whatever it corresponds to in Logic
    should be something that can appropriately be inserted between two
    sentences. Let's run through a short example to figure out what that
    might be. To keep things
    simple we'll work inside the universal set \(U=\{ 1, 2, 3, \ldots 50 \}\).
    Let \(T\) be the subset of \(U\) consisting of those numbers that are
    divisible by 10, and let \(F\) be those that are divisible by 5.
    \begin{equation*}
      T = \{10, 20, 30, 40, 50 \}
    \end{equation*}
    \begin{equation*}
      F = \{5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50 \}
    \end{equation*}
