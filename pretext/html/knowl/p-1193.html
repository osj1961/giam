    A  <!--Style me with CSS--><em>graph</em> is a mathematical structure consisting of
    two sets, a set \(V\) of points (a.k.a. vertices) and a set<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-38" id="fn-38"><span class="footnote"><sup> 2 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-38" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">Technically, \(E\) is a so-called
    multiset in many instances — there may be several edges that connect the same pair of vertices.</span></span> \(E\) of edges.
    The elements of \(E\) may be either ordered or unordered pairs from \(V\).
    If \(E\) consists of ordered pairs we have a 
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>directed graph</em> or <!--Style me with CSS--><em>digraph</em> — the diagrams we have been using to visualize
    relations! If \(E\) consists of unordered
    pairs then we are dealing with an <!--Style me with CSS--><em>undirected graph</em>. Since the
    undirected case is actually the more usual, if the word “graph” appears without
    a modifier it is assumed that we are talking about an undirected graph.
