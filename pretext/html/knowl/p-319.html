    One could, in principle, verify all logical equivalences by filling out
    truth tables. Indeed, in the exercises for this section we will ask you
    to develop a certain facility at this task. While this activity can
    be somewhat fun, and many of my students want the filling-out of truth
    tables to
    be a significant portion of their midterm exam, you will probably eventually
    come to find it somewhat tedious. A slightly more mature approach to logical
    equivalences is this: use a set of basic equivalences — which themselves
    may be verified via truth tables — as the basic <!--Style me with CSS--><em>rules</em> or
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>laws</em>
    of logical equivalence, and develop a strategy for converting one
    sentence into another using these rules. This process will feel very
    familiar, it is like “doing” algebra, but the rules one is allowed
    to use are subtly different.
