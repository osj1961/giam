    There are quite a few occasions when we need to prove statements
    involving the  unique existence quantifier
    (\(\exists !\)). In
    such instances we need to do just a little bit more work. We
    need to show existence — either constructively or non-constructively — and we also need to show uniqueness. To give an example of
    a unique existence proof we'll return to a concept first
    discussed in <a href="sec_alg.html" alt="Section 1.5 Some algorithms of elementary number theory" title="Section 1.5 Some algorithms of elementary number theory">Section 1.5</a> and finish-up some business
    that was glossed-over there.
