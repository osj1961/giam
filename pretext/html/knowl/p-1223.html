    Recapping, a function <!--Style me with CSS--><em>must</em> have its domain equal to the set \(A\)
    where its inputs come from. This is sometimes expressed by saying that
    a function is <!--Style me with CSS--><em>defined</em> on its domain. A function's range and codomain
    may be different however. In the event that the range and codomain <!--Style me with CSS--><em>are</em>
    the same (\(\Cod{\relR} = \Rng{\relR}\))
    we have a rather special situation and the function is graced by
    the appellation “surjection.” The term “onto” is also commonly used
    to describe a surjective function.
