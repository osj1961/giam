<p>
      Suppose on the contrary that there are only a finite number
      of primes. This finite set of prime numbers could, in principle, be listed
      in ascending order.
      \begin{equation*}
        \{ p_1, p_2, p_3, \ldots , p_n \}
      \end{equation*}
    </p>
<p>
      Consider the number \(N\) formed by adding 1 to the product of all of these
      primes.
      \begin{equation*}
        N = 1 + \prod_{k=1}^n p_k
      \end{equation*}
    </p>
<p>
      Clearly, \(N\) is much larger than the largest prime \(p_n\), so \(N\) cannot
      be a prime number itself. Thus \(N\) must be a product of some of the
      primes in the list. Suppose that \(p_j\) is one of the primes that
      divides \(N\). Now notice that, by construction, \(N\) would leave remainder
      \(1\) upon division by \(p_j\). This is a contradiction since we cannot have
      both \(p_j \divides N\) and \(p_j \nmid N\).
    </p>
<p>
      Since the supposition that there are only finitely many primes leads to
      a contradiction, there must indeed be an infinite number of primes.
