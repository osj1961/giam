<p>
      First we will show that \(f\) is surjective.
    </p>
<p>
      It suffices to find a preimage for an arbitrary element of \(\Integers\).
      Suppose that \(y\) is a particular but arbitrarily chosen integer. There
      are two cases to consider: \(y\leq 0\) and \(y&gt;0\).
    </p>
<p>
      If \(y&gt;0\) then \(x=2y\) is a preimage for \(y\). This follows easily since
      \(x=2y\) is obviously even and so \(x\)'s image will be
      defined by the first case in the definition of \(f\). Thus \(f(x) = f(2y) =
      (2y)/2 = y\).
    </p>
<p>
      If \(y \leq 0\) then \(x=1-2y\) is a preimage for \(y\). Clearly, \(1-2y\) is odd
      whenever \(y\) is an integer, thus this value for \(x\) will fall into the second
      case in the definition of \(f\). So, \(f(x) = f(1-2y) = -((1-2y)-1)/2 = -(-2y)/2 = y\).
    </p>
<p>
      Since the cases \(y&gt;0\) and \(y\leq 0\) are exhaustive (that is, every \(y\) in
      \(\Integers\) falls into one or the other of these cases), and we have found
      a preimage for \(y\) in both cases, it follows that \(f\) is surjective.
    </p>
<p>
      Next, we will show that \(f\) is injective.
    </p>
<p>
      Suppose that \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) are elements of \(\Naturals\) and that
      \(f(x_1)=f(x_2)\). Consider the following three cases: \(x_1\) and \(x_2\)
      are both even, both odd, or have opposite parity.
    </p>
<p>
      If \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) are both even, then by the definition of \(f\) we
      have \(f(x_1) = x_1/2\) and \(f(x_2) = x_2/2\) and since these functional
      values are equal, we have \(x_1/2 = x_2/2\). Doubling both sides of this
      leads to \(x_1=x_2\).
    </p>
<p>
      If \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) are both odd, then by the definition of \(f\) we
      have \(f(x_1) = -(x_1-1)/2\) and \(f(x_2) = -(x_2-1)/2\) and since these functional
      values are equal, we have \(-(x_1-1)/2 = -(x_2-1)/2\). A bit more
      algebra (doubling, negating and adding one to both sides) leads to
      \(x_1=x_2\).
    </p>
<p>
      If \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) have opposite parity, we will assume w.l.o.g. that
      \(x_1\) is even and \(x_2\) is odd. The equality \(f(x_1)=f(x_2)\) becomes
      \(x_1/2 = -(x_2-1)/2\). Note that \(x_1 \geq 2\) so \(f(x_1) = x_1/2 \geq 1\).
      Also, note that \(x_2 \geq 1\) so
      \begin{gather*}
x_2 - 1 \geq 0\\
(x_2-1)/2 \geq 0\\
-(x_2-1)/2 \leq 0\\
f(x_2) \leq 0
\end{gather*}
      therefore we have a contradiction since it is impossible
      for the two values \(f(x_1)\) and \(f(x_2)\) to be equal while \(f(x_1) \geq 1\)
      and \(f(x_2) \leq 0\).
    </p>
<p>
      Since the last case under consideration leads to a contradiction, it follows
      that \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) never have opposite parities, and so the first two
      cases are exhaustive â€” in both of those cases we reached the desired
      conclusion that \(x_1 = x_2\) so it follows that \(f\) is injective.
