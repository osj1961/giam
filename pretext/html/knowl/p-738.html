    Armed with this definition, let's return our attention to proving the
    unique existence of the gcd. The uniqueness part is easier so we'll
    do that first. We argue by contradiction. Suppose that there were
    two different numbers \(d\) and \(d'\) satisfying the definition of \(\gcd{a}{b}\).
    Put \(d'\) in the place of \(c\) in the definition to see that \(d' \divides d\).
    Similarly, we can deduce that \(d \divides d'\) and if two numbers each divide
    into the other, they must be equal. This is a contradiction since we
    assumed \(d\) and \(d'\) were different.
