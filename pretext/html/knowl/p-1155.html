    We paraphrased transitivity as “Whenever there's a roundabout route, there's a direct route.”
    In particular, what the definition says is that <!--Style me with CSS--><em>if</em> there's a connection from \(a\) to \(b\) and from
    \(b\) to \(c\) (the roundabout route from \(a\) to \(c\)) then there must be a connection from \(a\) to \(c\) (the direct
    route).
