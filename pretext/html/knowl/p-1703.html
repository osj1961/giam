    Conway's big insight was to associate the powers of some number \(r\) with
    the positions on the board â€” \(r^k\) goes on the squares that are distance
    \(k\) from the target location. If we have a man who is actually <!--Style me with CSS--><em>at</em>
    the target location, he will be worth \(r^0\) or \(1\). We need to arrange for
    two things to happen: the sum of all the powers of \(r\) in the initial setup
    of the board must be less than or equal to 1, and checker-jumping moves should
    result in the total value of a set of men going down or (at worst) staying
    the same. These goals push us in different directions: In order for the initial sum to be less
    than 1, we would like to choose \(r\) to be fairly small. In order to have checker-jumping moves we need to choose \(r\) to be (relatively) larger. Is there a value of \(r\) that does the trick? Can we find a balance between these competing
    desires?
