    In Mathematics we distinguish two main connectives for hooking-up simple
    sentences into compound ones. The <!--Style me with CSS--><em>conjunction</em>
    of two sentences is
    the compound sentence made by sticking the word “and” between them.
    The <!--Style me with CSS--><em>disjunction</em> of two sentences is
    formed by placing an “or”
    between them. Conjunctions are true only when both components are true.
    Disjunctions are false only when both components are false.
