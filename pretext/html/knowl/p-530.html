    This last argument exhibits the so-called <!--Style me with CSS--><em>inverse error</em>. It is by
    no means meant as a guarantee, but nevertheless, it seems reasonable that
    if someone reads this book they will pass a course on this material.
    The second premise is also easy to envision as true, although the
    “you” that it refers to obviously isn't <!--Style me with CSS--><em>you</em>, because <!--Style me with CSS--><em>you</em>
    are reading this book! But even if we accept the premises as true, the
    conclusion doesn't follow. A person might have read some other book that
    addressed the requisite material in an exemplary way.
