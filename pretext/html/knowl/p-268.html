    Using this graphical “language” one can make schematic
    representations of logical expressions. Some find that
    tracing such diagrams makes understanding the structure
    of a Boolean expression easier. For example, in <span>&lt;&lt;Unresolved xref, reference "fig_3ands"; check spelling or use "provisional" attribute&gt;&gt;</span>
    we illustrate 2 of the possible ways that the conjunction
    of four predicate variables can be parenthesized. In fact, when
    a multitude of predicates are joined by the same connective,
    the way in which the expression is parenthesized is unimportant,
    thus one often sees a further shorthand — gates with more than
    2 inputs.
