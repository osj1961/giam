    To recap, the converse of an implication has the pieces (antecedent and
    consequent) switched about. The inverse of an implication has the
    pieces negated. Neither of these is the same as the original implication.
    Oddly, this is one of those times when two wrongs <!--Style me with CSS--><em>do</em> make a right.
    If you start with an implication, form its converse, then take the inverse
    of that, you get a statement having exactly the same logical meaning
    as the original. This new statement is called the
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>contrapositive</em>.
