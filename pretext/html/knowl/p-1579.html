    We need to produce a formula. In truth, we should really produce two
    formulas. One that takes an ordered pair \((x, y)\) and produces a number \(n\).
    Another that takes a number \(n\) and produces an ordered pair \((x, y)\) The
    number \(n\) tells us where the pair \((x, y)\) lies in our infinite listing.
    There is a
    problem though: the second formula (that gives the map from \(\Naturals\)
    to \(\Naturals \times \Naturals\))
    is really hard to write down â€” it's easier to describe the map
    algorithmically.
    A simple observation will help us to deduce the various formulas. The
    ordered pairs along the \(y\)-axis (those of the form (0, something)) correspond
    to triangular numbers. In fact the pair \((0, n)\) will correspond to the \(n\)-th triangular
    number, \(T(n) = (n^2 + n)/2\). The ordered pairs along the descending
    slanted line starting from \((0, n)\) all have the feature that the sum of their
    coordinates is \(n\) (because as the \(x\)-coordinate is increasing, the
    \(y\)-coordinate
    is decreasing). So, given an ordered pair \((x, y)\), the number corresponding
    to the position at the upper end of the slanted line it is on (which will have
    coordinates \((0, x+y)\)) will be \(T(x+y)\), and the pair \((x, y)\) occurs in the listing exactly \(x\) positions after \((0, x + y)\). Thus, the function
    \(f : \Naturals \times \Naturals \longrightarrow N\) is
    given by
    \begin{equation*}
      f(x, y) \; = \; x + T(x + y) = x + \frac{(x + y)^2 + (x + y)}{2}.
    \end{equation*}
