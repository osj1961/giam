    Obviously, listing all such sequences would be an arduous task.
    We might start with \((1,2,3,4,5,6)\) and try to proceed in some
    orderly fashion to \((15,16,17,18,19,20)\), but unfortunately there
    are 38,760 such sequences so unless we enlist the aid of a computer
    we are unlikely to finish this job in a reasonable time. The number
    we've just given (38,760) is \(C(20,6)\) and so it would seem that we're
    claiming that this problem is really unordered selection without repetition
    of 6 things out of 20. Well, actually, some parts of this are clearly
    right — we are selecting 6 things from a set of size 20, and because
    our sequences are supposed to be <!--Style me with CSS--><em>strictly</em> increasing there will
    be no repetitions — but, a strictly increasing sequence is clearly
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>ordered</em> and the formula we are using is for <!--Style me with CSS--><em>unordered</em>
    collections.
