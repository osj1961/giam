    In a Venn diagram the
    universe of discourse is normally drawn as
    a rectangular region inside of which all the action occurs. Each
    set in a Venn diagram is depicted by drawing a simple closed curve â€” typically a circle, but not necessarily! For instance, if you
    want to draw a Venn diagram that shows all the possible intersections
    among four sets, you'll find it's impossible with (only) circles.
