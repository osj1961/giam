      Clearly, \(N\) is much larger than the largest prime \(p_n\), so \(N\) cannot
      be a prime number itself. Thus \(N\) must be a product of some of the
      primes in the list. Suppose that \(p_j\) is one of the primes that
      divides \(N\). Now notice that, by construction, \(N\) would leave remainder
      \(1\) upon division by \(p_j\). This is a contradiction since we cannot have
      both \(p_j \divides N\) and \(p_j \nmid N\).
