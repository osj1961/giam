    This business about ordered versus unordered comes up fairly often so it's
    worth investing a few moments to figure out how it works. If a collection
    of things that is inherently unordered is handed to us we generally <!--Style me with CSS--><em>put</em>
    them in an order that is pleasing to us. Consider receiving five cards
    from the dealer in a card game, or extracting seven letters from the bag
    in a game of Scrabble. If, on the other hand, we receive
    a collection where order
    is important we certainly <!--Style me with CSS--><em>may not</em> rearrange them. Imagine someone
    receiving the telephone number of an attractive other but writing it down
    with the digits sorted in increasing order!
