    To show that a function is surjective we need to show that it is
    possible to find a preimage for every element of the codomain. If
    we happen to know what the inverse function is, then it is easy to
    find a preimage for an arbitrary element. In terms of the taxonomy
    for proofs that was introduced in <a href="ch_proof1.html" alt="Chapter 3 Proof techniques I — Standard methods" title="Chapter 3 Proof techniques I — Standard methods">Chapter 3</a>, we are talking
    about a constructive proof of an existential statement. A function \(f\)
    is surjective iff \(\forall y \in \Cod{f}, \exists x \in \Dom{f}, 
    y = f(x)\), so to prove surjectivity is to find the \(x\) that “works” for an
    arbitrary \(y\). If this is done by literally naming \(x\), we have
    proved the statement constructively.
