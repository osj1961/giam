    You may be surprised to learn that the pattern of 8 men which are needed to
    get someone three steps into the void can be re-created — shifted up by one
    unit — using just 12 men. This means that we can get a man 4 steps into
    enemy territory using \(12 + 8 = 20\) men. You were expecting 16 weren't you?
