     Graph pebbling is an interesting concept originated
    by the famous combinatorialist  Fan Chung. A “graph”
    (as the term is used here) is a collection
    of places or locations which are known as “nodes,” some of which
    are joined by paths or connections which are known as “edges.”
    Graphs have been studied by mathematicians for about 400 years, and
    many interesting problems can be put in this setting. Graph pebbling
    is a crude version of a broader problem in resource management — often
    a resource actually gets used in the process of transporting it. Think of
    the big tanker trucks that are used to transport gasoline. What do they
    run on? Well, actually they probably burn diesel — but the point is
    that in order to move the fuel around we have to consume some of it.
    Graph pebbling takes this to an extreme: in order to move one pebble
    we must consume one pebble.
