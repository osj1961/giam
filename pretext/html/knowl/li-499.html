          An argument very similar to the one embodied in the proof of Cantor's
          theorem is found in the Barber's paradox. This paradox was
          originally introduced in the popular press in order to give laypeople an
          understanding of Cantor's theorem and Russell's paradox. It sounds
          somewhat sexist to modern ears. (For example, it is presumed without
          comment that the Barber is male.)
          <blockquote>
          In a small town there is a Barber who shaves those men (and
          only those men) who do not shave themselves. Who shaves
          the Barber?
          </blockquote>
          Explain the similarity to the proof of Cantor's theorem.
