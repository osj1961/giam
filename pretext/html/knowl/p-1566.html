    There is an ancient conundrum about what happens when an irresistible force
    meets an immovable object. In a similar spirit there are sometimes heated
    debates among young children concerning which super-hero will win a fight.
    Can Wolverine take Batman? What about the Incredible Hulk versus the
    Thing? Certainly Superman is at the top of the heap in this ordering. Or is
    he? Would the man of steel even engage in a fight with a female super-hero,
    say Wonder Woman? (Remember the 1950's sensibilities of Clark Kent's
    alter ego.)
