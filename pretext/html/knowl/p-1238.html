    To show that a function
    is an injection, we traditionally prove that the property used in the
    definition of an injective function is true. Namely, we suppose that
    \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) are distinct elements of \(\Dom{f}\) and that
    \(f(x_1)=f(x_2)\) and then we show that actually \(x_1 = x_2\). This is
    in the spirit of a proof by contradiction â€” if there were actually
    distinct elements that get mapped to the same value then \(f\) would <!--Style me with CSS--><em>not</em>
    be injective, but by deducing that \(x_1=x_2\) we are contradicting that
    presumption and so, are showing that \(f\) is indeed an injection.
