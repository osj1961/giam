    Between 1670 and 1994 a lot of famous mathematicians worked on FLT but
    never found the “demonstrationem mirabilem.” Finally in 1994, Andrew Wiles
    of Princeton announced a proof of FLT, but in Wiles's own words, his is “a twentieth century proof” it can't be the proof Fermat had in mind.
