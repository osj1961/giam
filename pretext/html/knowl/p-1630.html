    There is a cute thought-experiment called Hilbert's Hotel that will lead
    us to a technique for developing an injective function in the other direction.
    Hilbert's Hotel has \(\aleph_0\) rooms. If any countable collection of
    guests show up there will be enough rooms for everyone. Suppose you
    arrive at Hilbert's hotel one dark and stormy evening and the
    “No Vacancy” light is on — there are already a
    denumerable number of guests there — every room is full. The clerk
    sees you dejectedly considering your options, trying to think of
    another hotel that might still have rooms when, clearly, a <!--Style me with CSS--><em>very</em>
    large convention is in town. He rushes out and says
    “My friend, have no fear! Even though we have no vacancies,
    there is always room for one more at our establishment.”
    He goes into the office and makes the following announcement
    on the PA system. “Ladies and Gentlemen, in order to accommodate
    an incoming guest, please vacate your room and move to the room
    numbered one higher. Thank you.” There
    is an infinite amount of grumbling, but shortly you find yourself occupying
    room number \(1\).
