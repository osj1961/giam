    Russell himself developed a workaround for the paradox which
    bears his name. Together with Alfred North Whitehead he published
    a 3 volume work entitled <!--Style me with CSS--><em>Principia Mathematica</em><span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-29" id="fn-29"><span class="footnote"><sup> 2 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-29" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">Isaac Newton
    also published a 3 volume work which is often cited by this same title,
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica</em>.</span></span> <a knowl="./knowl/PM.html" knowl-id="xref-PM" alt="Bibliographic Entry 17 " title="Bibliographic Entry 17 ">[17]</a>.
    In the Principia, Whitehead and Russell develop a system known as
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>type theory</em> which sets forth principles for avoiding problems
    like Russell's paradox. Basically, a set and its elements are of
    different “types” and so the notion of a set being contained in itself
    (as an element) is disallowed.
