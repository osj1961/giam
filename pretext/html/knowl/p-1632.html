    The proof we will present here<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-58" id="fn-58"><span class="footnote"><sup> 2 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-58" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">We first encountered this proof 
    in a Wikipedia article <a knowl="./knowl/wiki-CBS.html" knowl-id="xref-wiki-CBS" alt="Bibliographic Entry 3 " title="Bibliographic Entry 3 ">[3]</a>.</span></span> is attributed to Julius König.
    König was a contemporary of Cantor's who was (initially) very
    much respected by him. Cantor came to dislike König after the
    latter presented a well-publicized (and ultimately wrong) lecture
    claiming the continuum hypothesis was false.
    Apparently the continuum hypothesis was one of Cantor's favorite ideas,
    because he seems to have construed König's lecture as a personal attack.
    Anyway…
