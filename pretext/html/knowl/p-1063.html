    Mathematical induction
    can often be used to prove inequalities. There are quite a few examples
    of families of statements where there is an inequality for every natural
    number. Often such statements seem to be <!--Style me with CSS--><em>obviously</em> true and yet
    devising a proof can be illusive. If such is the case, try using PMI.
    One hint: it is fairly typical that the inductive step in a PMI proof
    of an inequality will involve reasoning that isn't particularly sharp.
    Just remember that if you have an inequality and you make the big
    side even bigger, the resulting statement is certainly still true!
