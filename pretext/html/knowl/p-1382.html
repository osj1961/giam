    In general, when we are selecting \(k\) things from a set of size \(n\)
    (with repetition and without order) we will need to consider
    blank-comma arrangements having \(k\) blanks and \(n-1\) commas. As an
    aid to memory, consider that when you actually write-out the elements
    of a set it takes one fewer commas than there are elements â€” for example
    \(\{1,2,3,4\}\) has 4 elements but we only need 3 commas to separate them.
    The general answer to our problem is either \(C(k+n-1,k)\) or
    \(C(k+n-1, n-1)\), depending on whether you want to think about
    selecting positions for the \(k\) blanks or for the \(n-1\) commas.
    It turns out that these binomial coefficients are equal so there's
    no problem with the apparent ambiguity.
