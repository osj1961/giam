    We'll try to handle the general situation in a bit, but for the moment let's
    consider the nice case: when the inverse of a function is also a function.
    When exactly does this happen? Well, we have just seen that the inverse
    of a function doesn't necessarily pass the vertical line test, and it turns
    out that that is the predominant issue. So, under what circumstances does
    the inverse pass the vertical line test? When the original function
    passes the so-called horizontal line test (every horizontal line
    intersects the graph at most once). Thinking again about \(f(x)=x^2\), there
    are some horizontal lines that miss the graph entirely, but all horizontal
    lines of the form \(y=c\) where \(c\) is positive will intersect the graph twice.
    There are many functions that <!--Style me with CSS--><em>do</em> pass the horizontal line test, for
    instance, consider \(f(x) = x^3\). Such functions are known as
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>injections</em>, this is the same thing as
    saying a function is “one-to-one.” Injective functions can be inverted — the domain of the inverse function of \(f\) will only be the range, \(\Rng{f}\),
    which as we have seen may fall short of the being the entire codomain, since
    \(\Rng{f} \subseteq \Cod{f}\).
