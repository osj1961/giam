    Russell was an ardent anti-war and anti-nuclear activist. He achieved a
    status (shared with Albert Einstein, but very few others) as an eminent
    scientist who was also a powerful moral authority. Russell's mathematical
    work was of a very abstruse foundational sort; he was concerned with
    the idea of reducing all mathematical thought to Logic and Set theory.
