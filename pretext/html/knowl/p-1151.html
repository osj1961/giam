    This definition may seem more straight-forward, but it turns out the original definition is
    easier to use in proofs. We need to convince ourselves that the (first) definition really
    accomplishes what we want. Namely, if a relation \(\relR\) satisfies the property that
    \(\displaystyle \forall a,b \in S,  a \relR b \; \land \; b \relR a  \implies  a=b\),
    then there will not actually be any pair of elements that are related in both orders. One
    way to think about it is this: suppose that \(a\) and \(b\) are distinct elements of \(S\) and
    that both \(a \relR b\) and \(b \relR a\) are true. The property now guarantees that \(a=b\)
    which contradicts the notion that \(a\) and \(b\) are distinct. This is a miniature proof
    by contradiction; if you assume there <!--Style me with CSS--><em>are</em> a pair of distinct elements that are
    related in both orders you get a contradiction, so there <!--Style me with CSS--><em>aren't</em>!
