    As we've noted earlier, an argument by deductive reasoning can go wrong
    in only certain well-understood ways. Basically, either the form of the
    argument is invalid, or at least one of the premises is false. Avoiding
    false premises in your arguments can be trickier than it sounds — many
    statements that sound appealing or intuitively clear are actually
    counter-factual. The other side of the coin, being sure that the
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>form</em>
    of your argument is valid, seems easy enough — just be
    sure to only use the rules of inference as found in <a knowl="./knowl/tab_roi.html" knowl-id="xref-tab_roi" alt="Table 2.6.2 " title="Table 2.6.2 ">Table 2.6.2</a>.
    Unfortunately most arguments that you either read or write
    will be in prose, rather than appearing as a formal list of deductions.
    When dealing with that setting — using natural rather than formalized
    language — making errors in form is quite common.
