    Notice that if a sequence is either cyclic or infinite it doesn't matter
    whether we use \(f\) or \(g^{-1}\) since both will be
    defined for all elements of such
    sequences. Also, certainly \(f\) will work if we are in an \(A\)-stopper.
    The function we've just created is perfectly well-defined, but it may take
    arbitrarily long to determine whether we have an element of a \(B\)-stopper, as
    opposed to an element of an infinite sequence. We cannot determine whether
    we're in an infinite versus a finite sequence in a prescribed finite number of
    steps.
