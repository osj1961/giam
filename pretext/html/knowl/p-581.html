    These definitions are our only available tools so we'll certainly <!--Style me with CSS--><em>have</em>
    to make use of them, and it's important to notice that that is a good thing;
    the definitions allow us to work with something well-understood
    (the inequalities that appear within them) rather than with something
    new and relatively suspicious (the floor notation). Putting the proof
    of this statement together is an exercise in staring at the two definitions
    above and noting how one can be converted into the other. It is also a
    testament to the power of <!--Style me with CSS--><em>naming</em> things.
