    We take the view that an algorithm is something like a function, it
    takes for its input a list of parameters that describe a particular
    case of some general problem, and produces as its output a solution to
    that problem. (It should be noted that there are other possibilities — some programs require that the variable in which the output is to
    be placed be handed them as an input parameter, others have no
    specific output, their purpose is achieved as a side-effect.) The
    intermediary between input and output is the algorithm instructions
    themselves and a set of so-called local variables which are used much
    the way scrap paper is used in a hand calculation — intermediate
    calculations are written on them, but they are tossed aside once the
    final answer has been calculated.
