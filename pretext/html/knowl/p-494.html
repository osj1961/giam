    Each of the rules of inference actually amounts to a logical tautology
    that has been re-expressed as a sort of re-writing rule. Each rule
    of inference will be expressed as a list of logical
    sentences that are assumed to be among the premises of the argument,
    a horizontal bar, followed by the symbol \(\therefore\) (which is
    usually voiced as the word “therefore”) and then a new statement
    that can be placed among the deductions.
