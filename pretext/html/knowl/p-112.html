      Suppose after a party we have 43 unopened bottles of beer. We'd like
      to store them in containers that hold 12 bottles each. How many
      containers will we need? Again, this is simply a division problem — \(43/12 = 3.58\overline{333}\). So we need 3 boxes and another
      7 twelfths of a box. Obviously we really need 4 boxes — at least one
      will have some unused space in it. In this sort of situation
      we're dealing with the ceiling function.
      Given a real number, the ceiling function rounds it up to the
      next integer.
