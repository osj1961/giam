    There are a great many functions that fail the horizontal line test
    which we nevertheless seem to have inverse functions for. For example,
    \(x^2\) fails HLT but \(\sqrt{x}\) is a pretty reasonable inverse for it — one just needs to be careful about the “plus or minus” issue. Also,
    \(\sin{x}\) fails HLT pretty badly; any horizontal line \(y=c\) with
    \(-1 \leq c \leq 1\) will hit \(\sin{x}\) infinitely many times. But look!
    Right here on my calculator is a button labeled “\(\sin^{-1}\).”<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-41" id="fn-41"><span class="footnote"><sup> 1 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-41" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">It

    of a trig. function was arc-whatever.  So the inverse of sine was arcsine,
    the inverse of tangent was arctangent.</span></span> This apparent contradiction
    can be resolved using the notion of restriction.
