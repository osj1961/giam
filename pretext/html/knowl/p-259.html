    In addition to these connectors we need a modifier (called
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>negation</em>)
    that acts on individual sentences. The negation of a sentence \(A\) is
    denoted by \({\lnot}A\), and its truth value is exactly the opposite of
    \(A\)'s truth value. The negation of a sentence is also known as the
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>denial</em> of a sentence.
    A truth table for the negation operator is somewhat
    trivial but we include it here for completeness.
