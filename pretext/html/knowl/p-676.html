          Find a counterexample to the conjecture that \(\forall a,b,c \in \Integers, a \divides bc \; \implies \; a \divides b \, \lor \, a \divides c\)  using only powers of 2.

          \hint{The intent of the problem is that you find three numbers, \(a\), \(b\) and \(c\), that are all powers 
          of \(2\) and such that \(a\) divides the product \(bc\), but neither of the factors separately. For instance, 
          if you pick \(a=16\), then you would need to choose \(b\) and \(c\) so that \(16\) doesn't divide evenly 
          into them (they would need to be less than \(16\)â€¦) but so that their product <!--Style me with CSS--><em>is</em> divisible by \(16\).
          }
