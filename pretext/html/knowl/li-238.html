          Prove that if \(x\) is an odd integer, then \(x^2\) is of the form
          \(4k+1\) for some integer \(k\).

          \hint{



           You may be tempted to write “Since x is odd, it can be expressed as \(x = 2k+1\) where \(k\) is an integer.” This is slightly wrong since the variable \(k\) is already being used in the statement of the theorem. But, except for replacing \(k\) with some other variable (maybe \(m\) or \(j\)?) that <!--Style me with CSS--><em>is</em> a good way to get started. From there it's really just algebra until, eventually, you'll find out what \(k\) really is.
