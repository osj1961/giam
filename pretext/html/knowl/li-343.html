          Argue as to why rectilinear curves will suffice to build
          any Venn diagram.

          \hint{Fortunately the instructions don't say to <!--Style me with CSS--><em>prove</em> that rectilinear curves will always
          suffice, so we can be less rigorous.  Try to argue as to why it will alway be possible to add one more rectilinear curve to an existing Venn diagram and split every region into two.

          One might also argue that any continuous curve can be approximated using rectilinear curves.  So if a Venn diagram can be constructed using continuous curves we can also get the job done with rectilinear curves.}
