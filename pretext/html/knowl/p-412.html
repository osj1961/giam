    In the next example we'll highlight a slightly sloppy habit of thought
    that tends to be problematic. People usually (at first) associate a
    direction with the basic logical equivalences. This is reasonable
    for several of them because one side is markedly simpler than the
    other. For example, the domination rule would normally be used
    to replace a part of a statement that looked like “\(A \land c\)” with
    the simpler expression “\(c\)”. There is a certain amount of strategization
    necessary in doing these proofs, and I usually advise people to start
    with the more complicated side of the equivalence to be proved. It just
    feels right to work in the direction of making things simpler, but there
    are times when one has to take one step back before proceeding two steps
    forward…
