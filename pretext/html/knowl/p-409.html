    We're going to go through a couple of examples of two-column proofs
    in the context of proving logical equivalences. One thing to watch out
    for: if you're trying to prove a given equivalence, and the first thing
    you write down is that very equivalence, <!--Style me with CSS--><em>it's wrong!</em> This
    would constitute the logical error known as
    “begging the question”
    also known as “circular reasoning.”
    It's clearly not okay to try
    to demonstrate some fact by first <!--Style me with CSS--><em>asserting the very same fact</em>.
    Nevertheless, there is (for some unknown reason) a powerful temptation
    to do this very thing. To avoid making this error, we will not
    put any equivalences on a single line. Instead we will start with
    one side or the other of the statement to be proved, and modify it
    using known rules of equivalence, until we arrive at the other side.
