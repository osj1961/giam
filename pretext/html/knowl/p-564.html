    In devising the proof above, we multiplied out the consecutive numbers
    and then realized that we'd be done if we could find a polynomial in
    \(a\) whose square was \(a^4  + 6a^3 + 11a^2 + 6a + 1\). Now, obviously,
    we're going to need a quadratic polynomial, and because the leading
    term is \(a^4\) and the constant term is \(1\), it should be of the form
    \(a^2 + ma + 1\). Squaring this gives \(a^4 + 2ma^3 + (m^2+2)a^2 + 2ma + 1\)
    and comparing that result with what we want, we pretty quickly realize
    that \(m\) had better be 3. So it wasn't magic after all!
