          The <!--Style me with CSS--><em>trichotomy property</em> of the real 
          numbers simply states that every real number is either positive or negative 
          or zero.  Trichotomy can be used to prove many statements by looking at the
          three cases that it guarantees.  Develop a proof (by cases) that the square of
          any real number is non-negative.

          \hint{By trichotomy, x is either zero, negative, or positive. If x is zero, its square is zero. If x is negative, its square is positive. If x is positive, its square is also positive.}
