    This argument has been generalized many times, so this is the first in a
    class of things known as diagonal arguments. Diagonal arguments have been
    used to settle several important mathematical questions. There is a valid
    diagonal argument that even does what we'd originally set out to do: prove
    that \(\Naturals\) and \(\Reals\) are not equinumerous. Strangely, the
    argument can't be made to work in binary, and since you're going to be
    asked to write it up in the exercises, we want to point out one of the
    potential pitfalls.
    If we were to use a diagonal argument to show that \((0, 1)\) isn't countable,
    we would start by assuming that every element of \((0, 1)\) was written down in
    a list. For most real numbers in \((0, 1)\) we could write out their
    binary representation uniquely, but for some we would have to make a
    choice: should we write down the representation that terminates, or
    the one that ends in infinitely-many 1's? Suppose we choose to use
    the terminating representations, then none of the infinite binary
    strings that end with all 1's will be on the list. It's possible that
    the thing we get when we complement the diagonal
    is one of these (unlisted) binary strings so we don't <!--Style me with CSS--><em>necessarily</em>
    have a contradiction.
    If we make the other choice — use the infinite binary representation
    when we have a choice — there is a similar problem.
    You may think that our use of binary representations for real numbers
    was foolish in light of the failure of the argument to “go through”
    in binary.
    Especially since, as we've alluded to, it can be made to work in decimal.
    The reason for our apparent stubbornness is that these infinite binary
    strings do something else that's very nice. An infinitely long binary sequence
    can be thought of as the indicator function of a subset of N. For example,
    \(.001101010001\) is the indicator of \(\{2, 3, 5, 7, 11\}\).
