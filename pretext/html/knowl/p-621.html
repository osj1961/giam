          Suppose you have a savings account which bears interest 
          compounded monthly.  The July statement shows a balance of 
          $ 2104.87 and the September statement shows a balance $ 2125.97.
          What would be the balance on the (missing) August statement?

          \hint{A savings account where we are not depositing or withdrawing funds has a balance that is growing geometrically.}
