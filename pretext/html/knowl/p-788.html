    A set \(A\) is a <!--Style me with CSS--><em>subset</em> of another set \(B\) if all of \(A\)'s elements
    are also in \(B\). The terminology
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>superset</em> is used to refer
    to \(B\) in this situation, as in “The set of all real-valued functions
    in one real variable is a superset of the polynomial functions.” The
    subset/superset relationship is indicated with a symbol that should be
    thought of as a stylized version of the less-than-or-equal sign, when
    \(A\) is a subset of \(B\) we write \(A \subseteq B\).
