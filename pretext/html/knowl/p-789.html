    We say that \(A\) is
    a <!--Style me with CSS--><em>proper subset</em> of \(B\) if \(B\) has some elements that aren't in
    \(A\), and in this situation we write \(A \subset B\) or if we really want
    to emphasize the fact that the sets are not equal we can write
    \(A \subsetneq B\). By the way, if you want to emphasize the superset
    relationship, all of these symbols can be turned around. So for example
    \(A \supseteq B\) means that \(A\) is a superset of \(B\) although they could
    potentially be equal.
