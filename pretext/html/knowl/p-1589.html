    Now we're ready to put some of these ideas together in order to prove
    something really quite remarkable. It may be okay to say that line segments
    of different lengths are equinumerous — although ones intuition still balks
    at the idea that a line a mile long only has the same number of points on
    it as a line an inch long (or, if you prefer, make that a centimeter versus
    a kilometer). Would you believe that the entire line — that is the infinitely
    extended line — has no more points on it than a tiny little segment? You
    should be ready to prove this one yourself.
