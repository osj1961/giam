      You can also identify even numbers by considering their
      decimal representation. Recall that each digit in the
      decimal representation of a number has a value that depends
      on its position. For example, the number \(3482\) really means
      \(3\cdot10^3 + 4\cdot10^2 + 8\cdot10^1 + 2\cdot10^0\). This
      is also known as place notation.
      The fact that we use the
      powers of 10 in our place notation is probably due to the
      fact that most humans have 10 fingers. It is possible to
      use <!--Style me with CSS--><em>any</em> number in place of 10. In Computer Science there
      are 3 other bases in common use: 2, 8 and 16 — these are
      known (respectively) as binary, octal and hexadecimal notation.
      When denoting a number using some base other than 10, it is
      customary to append a subscript indicating the base.
      So, for example, \(1011_2\) is binary notation meaning
      \(1\cdot2^3 + 0\cdot2^2 + 1\cdot2^1 + 1\cdot2^0\) or \(8+2+1 = 11\).
      No matter what base we are using, the rightmost digit of
      the number multiplies the base raised to the \(0\)-th power.
      Any number raised to the \(0\)-th power is 1, and the rightmost
      digit is consequently known as the units digit. We are now
      prepared to give some statements that are equivalent to our
      definition of even. These statements truly don't deserve the
      designation “theorem,” they are immediate consequences of the
      definition.
