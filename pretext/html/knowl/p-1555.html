    Consider the solmization syllables used for the notes of the major scale
    in music; they form the set \(\{\mbox{do, re, mi, fa, so, la, ti} \}\).
    What are we doing when
    we count this set (and presumably come up with a total of 7 notes)? We first
    point at `do' while saying `one,' then point at `re' while saying `two,'
    et cetera.
    In a technical sense we are creating a one-to-one correspondence between the
    set containing the seven syllables and the special set \(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}\). You should notice that this one-to-one correspondence is by no means unique. For
    instance we could have counted the syllables in reverse — a descending scale,
    or in some funny order — a little melody using each note once. The fact that
    there are seven syllables in the solmization of the major scale is equivalent
    to saying that there exists a one-to-one correspondence between the syllables
    and the special set \(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}\). Saying “there exists” in this situation may seem a bit weak since in fact there are \(7! = 5040\) correspondences, but “there exists” is what we really want here. What exactly is a one-to-one
    correspondence? Well, we've actually seen such things before — a one-to-one
    correspondence is really just a bijective function between two sets. We're
    finally ready to write a definition that Georg Cantor would approve of.
