    The observant Calculus student will certainly be aware of the fact
    that, asymptotically, exponential functions grow faster than polynomial
    functions. That is, if you have a base \(b\) which is greater than 1, the
    function \(b^x\) is eventually larger than any polynomial \(p(x)\). This
    may seem a bit hard to believe if \(b=1.001\) and \(p(x) = 500x^{10}\). The
    graph of \(y=1.001^x\) is practically indistinguishable from the line \(y=1\)
    (at first), whereas the graph of \(y=500x^{10}\) has already reached the
    astronomical value of five trillion (\(5,000,000,000,000\)) when \(x\) is just
    \(10\). Nevertheless, the exponential will eventually outstrip the polynomial.
    We can use the methods of this section to get started on proving the fact
    mentioned above. Consider the two sequences \(n^2\) and \(2^n\).
