          We call a curve <!--Style me with CSS--><em>rectilinear</em> if it is made
          of line segments that meet at right angles.  If you have ever
          played with an Etch-a-Sketch you'll know what we mean by the term 
          “rectilinear.”  The following example of a rectilinear curve may
          also help to clarify this notion.

          Use rectilinear
          simple closed curves to create a Venn diagram for 5 sets.

          \hint{Of course, rectangles are rectilinear, so one could use the solution from the previous
          problem (if, unlike me, you were persistant enough to find it).  Otherwise, 
          start with the \(4\) set diagram made with rectangles and use your \(5\)th (rectilinear) curve to split
          each region into \(2\) — don't forget to split the region on the outside too.}
