    The relations we've discussed so far are 
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>binary</em> relations, that
    is, they go in between <!--Style me with CSS--><em>two</em> numbers. There are also higher order
    relations. For example, a famous  ternary
    relation (a relationship between
    three things) is the notion of “betweenness.” If \(A\), \(B\) and \(C\) are
    three points which all lie on a single line, we write \(A\star B \star C\)
    if \(B\) falls somewhere on the line segment \(\overline{AC}\). So the
    symbol \(A\star B \star C\) is shorthand for the sentence “Point \(B\) lies
    somewhere in between points \(A\) and \(C\) on the line determined by them.”
