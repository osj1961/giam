    Because most of the properties we are studying are defined using conditional statements
    it is often the case that a relation has a property for vacuous reasons. When the “if” part
    doesn't happen, there's no need for its corresponding “then” part to happen either — the
    conditional is still true. In the context of our discussion on the symmetry property of
    a relation this means that the following digraph <!--Style me with CSS--><em>is</em> the digraph of a symmetric
    relation (although it is neither reflexive nor irreflexive).
