    What exactly does the assumption that \(\Reals\) and \(\Naturals\) are
    equivalent mean?
    It means there is a one-to-one correspondence, that is, a bijective function
    from \(\Reals\) to \(\Naturals\). In a nutshell, it means that it is
    possible to list all the real
    numbers in a singly-infinite list. Now, it is certainly possible to make an
    infinite list of real numbers (since \(\Naturals \subseteq \Reals\),
    by listing the naturals themselves
    we are making an infinite list of reals!). The problem is that we would need
    to be sure that every real number is on the list somewhere. In fact, since
    we've used a geometric argument to show that the interval \((0, 1)\) and the
    set \(\Reals\) are equinumerous, it will be sufficient to presume that there
    is an infinite list containing all the numbers in the interval \((0, 1)\).
