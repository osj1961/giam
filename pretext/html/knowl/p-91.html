      You should note that there is a “two-way street” sort of quality
      to this definition — indeed with most, if not all, definitions. If
      a number is even, then we are guaranteed the existence of another
      integer half as big. On the other hand, if we can show that another
      integer half as big exists, then we know the original number is even.
      This two-wayness means that the definition is what is known as a
      <!--Style me with CSS--><em>biconditional</em>, a concept which we'll revisit in
      <a href="sec_impl.html" alt="Section 2.2 Implication" title="Section 2.2 Implication">Section 2.2</a>.
