    Most exhaustive proofs of statements that aren't trivial tend to either be (literally) too exhausting or to seem rather contrived. One example of a situation
    in which an exhaustive proof of some statement exists is when the statement
    is thought to be universally true but no general proof is known — yet the
    statement has been checked for a large number of cases.
    Goldbach's conjecture
    is one such statement.
    Christian Goldbach  <a knowl="./knowl/wiki-goldbach.html" knowl-id="xref-wiki-goldbach" alt="Bibliographic Entry 4 " title="Bibliographic Entry 4 ">[4]</a>
    was a mathematician born
    in Königsberg Prussia,
    who, curiously, did <!--Style me with CSS--><em>not</em> make the

    discussed previously in the exercises of <a href="sec_def.html" alt="Section 1.2 Definitions: Prime numbers" title="Section 1.2 Definitions: Prime numbers">Section 1.2</a></span></span> which bears
    his name. In a letter to
    Leonard Euler, Goldbach conjectured that every
    odd number greater than 5 could be expressed as the sum of three primes (nowadays this is known as the
     weak Goldbach conjecture). Euler apparently liked the
    problem and replied to Goldbach stating what is now known as Goldbach's
    conjecture: Every even number greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of
    two primes. This statement has been lying around since 1742, and a great
    many of the world's best mathematicians have made their attempts at proving it — to no avail! (Well, actually a lot of progress has been made but the result
    still hasn't been proved.) It's easy to verify the Goldbach conjecture for
    relatively small even numbers, so what <!--Style me with CSS--><em>has</em> been done is/are proofs by
    exhaustion of Goldbach's conjecture restricted to finite universes.
    As of this writing, the conjecture has been verified to be true of
    all even numbers less than \(2 \times 10^{17}\).
