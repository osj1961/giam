          The  <!--Style me with CSS--><em>octal</em> representation 
          of an integer uses powers of 8 in place notation.  The digits of an 
          octal number run from 0 to 7, one never sees 8's or 9's.  How would 
          you represent 8 and 9 as octal numbers?  What octal number comes 
          immediately after \(777_8\)?  What (decimal) number is \(777_8\)?





          \hint{Eight is \(10_8\), nine is \(11_8\). The point of asking questions about \(777\), is that (in octal) \(7\) is the digit that is analogous to \(9\) in base-\(10\). Thus \(777_8\) is something like \(999_{10}\) in that the number following both of them is written \(1000\) (although \(1000_8\) and \(1000_{10}\) are certainly not equal!)}
