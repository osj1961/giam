      A lot of people don't believe that \(0\) should be counted as an even
      number. Now that we are armed with a precise definition, we can
      answer this question easily. Is there an integer \(x\) such that
      \(0 = 2x\) ? Certainly! let \(x\) also be \(0\). (Notice that in the
      definition, nothing was said about \(m\) and \(n\) being distinct from
      one another.)
