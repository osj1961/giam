    This can be interpreted in terms of digraphs as follows: If a connection
    from \(a\) to \(b\) exists in the digraph of \(\relR\), then there must also be a connection
    from \(b\) to \(a\). In <span>&lt;&lt;Unresolved xref, reference "tab_rel_props"; check spelling or use "provisional" attribute&gt;&gt;</span> this is interpreted as “no one-way streets”
    and while that's not quite what it says, that <!--Style me with CSS--><em>is</em> the effect of this definition.
    Since <!--Style me with CSS--><em>if</em> a connection exists in one direction, there must also be a connection
    in the other direction, it follows that we will never see a one-way connection.
