    Rather than writing something like “\(e-2\)” or “0.7182818284590452354…”,
    we are going to in fact write “.1011011111100001010100010110001010001010 …”
    In other words, we are going to write the base-2 expansions of the real numbers
    in our list. Now, the issue of non-uniqueness is still there in binary, and
    in fact if we were to stay in base-10 it would be possible to plug a certain
    gap in our argument — but the binary version of this argument has some
    especially nice features.
    Every binary (or for that matter decimal) expansion corresponds to a unique
    real number, but it doesn't work out so well the other way around —
    there are sometimes two different binary expansions that correspond to the
    same real number. There is a lovely fact that we are not going to prove (you
    may get to see this result proved in a course in Real Analysis) that points up
    the problem. Whenever two different binary expansions represent the same
    real number, one of them is a terminating expansion (it ends in infinitely
    many 0's) and the other is an infinite expansion (it ends in infinitely many
    1's). We won't prove this fact, but the gist of the argument is a proof by
    contradiction — you may be able to get the point by studying <span>&lt;&lt;Unresolved xref, reference "fig_binary_reps"; check spelling or use "provisional" attribute&gt;&gt;</span>.
    (Try to see how it would be possible to find a number in between two binary
    expansions that didn't end in all-zeros and all-ones.)
