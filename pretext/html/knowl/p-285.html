    It is fairly common that conditionals are used to express threats,
    as in the peas/dessert example. Another common way to express a
    threat is to use a disjunction — “Finish your peas, or you won't
    get dessert.” If you've been paying attention (and did the last
    exercise), you will notice that this is <!--Style me with CSS--><em>not</em> the disjunction
    that should have the same meaning as the original conditional.
    There is probably no mother on Earth who would say
    “Don't finish your peas, or you get dessert!” to her child
    (certainly not if she expects to be understood). So what's going on
    here?
