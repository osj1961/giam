    The Principle of Mathematical Induction (PMI) may be the least intuitive
    proof method available to us. Indeed, at first, PMI may feel somewhat like
    grabbing yourself by the seat of your pants and lifting yourself into
    the air. Despite the indisputable fact that proofs by PMI often feel
    like magic, we need to convince you of the validity of this proof
    technique. It is one of the most important tools in your mathematical
    kit!
