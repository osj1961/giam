    Recall that when we were discussing sets we said the best way to describe
    a set is simply to list all of its elements. Well, what is the best
    way to describe a relation? In the same spirit, it would seem we should
    explicitly list all the things that make the relation true. But it takes
    a <!--Style me with CSS--><em>pair</em> of things, one to go on the left side and one to go on the
    right, to make a relation true (or for that matter false!). Also it should
    be evident that order is important in this context, for example \(2\lt 3\) is true
    but \(3\lt 2\) isn't. The identity of a relation is so intimately tied up with
    the set of ordered pairs that make it true, that when dealing with abstract
    relations we <!--Style me with CSS--><em>define them</em> as sets of ordered pairs.
