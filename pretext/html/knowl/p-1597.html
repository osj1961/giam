    Many people believe that the result known as Cantor's theorem says that
    the real numbers, \(\Reals\), have a greater cardinality than the natural numbers, \(\Naturals\).
    That isn't quite right. In fact Cantor's theorem is a much broader statement,
    one of whose consequences is that \(|\Reals| &gt; |\Naturals|\). Before we go
    on to discuss Cantor's theorem in full generality, we'll first explore it,
    essentially, in this simplified form.
    Once we know that \(|\Reals| \neq |\Naturals|\), we'll be in a position to
    explore a lot of
    interesting issues relative to the infinite. In particular, this result
    means that there are at least two cardinal numbers that are
    infinite — thus the “infinity is infinity” idea will be discredited.
    Once we have the full power of Cantor's
    theorem, we'll see just how completely wrong that concept is.
