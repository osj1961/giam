    Proof by exhaustion is the least attractive proof method from
    an aesthetic perspective. An exhaustive proof consists of literally
    (and exhaustively) checking every element of the universe to see
    if the given statement is true for it. Usually, of course, this is
    impossible because the universe of discourse is infinite; but when the
    universe of discourse is finite, one certainly can't argue the validity
    of an exhaustive proof.
