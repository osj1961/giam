    Taking \(\Naturals\) for granted, what is meant by the “all else”
    that humankind is responsible for? The basic sets of different types
    of “numbers” that every mathematics student should know are: \(\Naturals,
    \Integers, \Rationals, \Reals
    \; \mbox{and}  \; \Complexes\). Respectively: the naturals, the integers, the
    rationals, the reals, and the complex numbers. The use of \(\Naturals,
    \Reals \; \mbox{and}  \; \Complexes\) is probably clear to an English
    speaker. The integers are denoted with a \(\Integers\) because of the
    German word <!--Style me with CSS--><em>zählen</em> which means “to count.” The rational numbers are
    probably denoted using \(\Rationals\), for “quotients.” Etymology
    aside, is it possible for us to provide precise descriptions of these
    remaining sets?
