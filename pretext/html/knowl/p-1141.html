    There are a total of 5 properties that we have named, and we will discuss
    them all more thoroughly. But first, we'll state the formal definitions.
    Take note that these properties are all stated for a relation that goes
    from a set to itself, indeed, most of them wouldn't even make sense if
    we tried to define them for a relation from a set to a different set.
