    The multiplication rule gives
    us a way of counting things by thinking
    about how we might construct them. The numbers that are multiplied
    are the number of choices we have in the construction process.
    Surprisingly often, the number of choices we can make in a given
    stage of constructing some configuration is independent of the choices
    that have gone before â€” if this is not the case the multiplication rule
    may not apply.
