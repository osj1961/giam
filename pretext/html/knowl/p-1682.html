    In a nutshell, Conway's proof consists of starting with an equilateral
    triangle of unit side length, adding appropriately scaled versions of the
    six triangles above and ending up with a figure (having an equilateral
    Morley triangle) similar to \({\triangle}ABC\). The generic picture is
    given in <span>&lt;&lt;Unresolved xref, reference "fig_morley_conway_puzzle"; check spelling or use "provisional" attribute&gt;&gt;</span>. Before we can really
    count this argument as a proof, we need to say a bit more about what
    the phrase “appropriately scaled” means. In order to appropriately
    scale the triangles (the small acute ones) that appear green in <span>&lt;&lt;Unresolved xref, reference "fig_morley_conway_puzzle"; check spelling or use "provisional" attribute&gt;&gt;</span>
    we have a relatively easy job — just scale them so that the side
    opposite the trisected angle has length one; that way they will join
    perfectly with the central equilateral triangle.
