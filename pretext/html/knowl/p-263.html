    A very handy way of visualizing Boolean expressions is given by
    digital logic circuit diagrams. To discuss these diagrams we
    must make a brief digression into Electronics. One of the most
    basic components inside an electronic device is a 
    transistor,
    this is a component that acts like a switch for electricity,
    but the switch itself is controlled by electricity. In <a knowl="./knowl/fig_trans.html" knowl-id="xref-fig_trans" alt="Figure 2.1.2 " title="Figure 2.1.2 ">FigureÂ 2.1.2</a>
    we see the usual schematic representation of a transistor. If voltage
    is applied to the wire labeled z, the transistor becomes conductive,
    and current may flow from x to y.
