    If you've ever spent much time trying to check someone else's work
    in solving an algebraic problem, you'd probably agree that it
    would be a help to know what they were <!--Style me with CSS--><em>trying</em> to do in each
    step. Most people have this fairly vague notion that they're allowed
    to “do the same thing on both sides” and they're allowed to simplify
    the sides of the equation separately — but more often than not, several
    different things get done on a given line, mistakes get made, and it can
    be nearly impossible to figure out what went wrong and where.
