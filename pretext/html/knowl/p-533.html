    Determine the logical form of the following arguments.  Use symbols
    to express that form and determine whether the form is valid or invalid.
    If the form is invalid, determine the type of error made.  Comment on the 
    soundness of the argument as well, in particular, determine whether any of
    the premises are questionable.

          All who are guilty are in prison. 
            George is not in prison.  
            Therefore, George is not guilty.

          You should note that while the form is valid, there is something terribly wrong with this argument. Is it really true that everyone who is guilty of a crime is in prison?
