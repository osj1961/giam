    Notice how the external tangents<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-63" id="fn-63"><span class="footnote"><sup> 1 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-63" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">The reason I keep saying “external tangents” is that there are also <!--Style me with CSS--><em>internal</em> tangents.</span></span> to two of the circles meet in a point? Unless the circles just happen to have exactly the same size
    (And what are the odds of that?) this is going to be the case. Each pair of external tangents are going to meet in a point. There are three such pairs of external tangents and so they determine three points. I suppose, since these three
    points are determined in a fairly complicated way from three randomly chosen
    circles, that we would expect the three points to be pretty much random.
    Monge's circle theorem says that that isn't so.
