    Of course we need to generalize this procedure. One of the hardest parts
    of finding that generalization is finding the number \(4\) in the above example
    (when we just happen to notice that \(T(4)=10\) ). What we're really doing
    there is inverting the function \(T(n)\). Finding an inverse for
    \(T(n) = (n^2+n)/2\) was the essence of one of the exercises in
    <a href="sec_special_functions.html" alt="Section 6.5 Special functions" title="Section 6.5 Special functions">Section 6.5</a>.
    The parabola \(y = (x^2 + x)/2\) has roots at \(0\) and \(-1\) and is scaled by a
    factor of \(1/2\) relative to the “standard” parabola \(y = x^2\).
    Its vertex is at
    \((-1/2,-1/8)\). The graph of the inverse relation is, of course, obtained by
    reflecting through the line \(y = x\) and by considering scaling and horizontal/
    vertical translations we can deduce a formula for a function that gives a
    right inverse for \(T\),
    \begin{equation*}
      T^{-1}(x) = \sqrt{2x + 1/4} - 1/2.
    \end{equation*}
