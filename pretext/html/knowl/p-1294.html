    You should note that these projection functions are <!--Style me with CSS--><em>very</em> bad
    as far as being one-to-one is concerned. For instance, the preimage
    of \(1\) under the map \(\pi_1\) consists of all the points on the vertical line
    \(x=1\). That's a lot of preimages! These guys are so far from being
    one-to-one that it seems impossible to think of an appropriate restriction
    that would become invertible. Nevertheless, there is a function that
    provides a right inverse for both \(\pi_1\) and \(\pi_2\). Now, these projection
    maps go from \(\Reals \times \Reals\) to \(\Reals\) so an inverse needs to be
    a map from \(\Reals\) to \(\Reals \times \Reals\). What is a reasonable way to
    produce a <!--Style me with CSS--><em>pair</em> of real numbers if we have a single real number in hand?
    There are actually many ways one could proceed, but one reasonable choice is
    to create a pair where the input number appears in both coordinates. This
    is the so-called <!--Style me with CSS--><em>diagonal map</em>,
    \(d:\Reals \times \Reals \longrightarrow \Reals\), defined by \(d(a) = (a,a)\).
