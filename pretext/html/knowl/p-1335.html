    Now, we could use Yahtzee “hands” to provide us with a whole collection
    of counting problems once we have our basic counting principles,
    but for the moment we just want to make a simple (and obvious) point
    about “full houses” — the pair is either smaller or larger than
    the three-of-a-kind. This means we can partition the set of all possible
    full houses into two disjoint sets — the full houses consisting of a small
    pair and a larger three-of-a-kind and those where the pair is larger
    than the three-of-a-kind. If we can find some way of counting these
    two cases separately, then the total number of full houses will be the
    sum of these numbers.
