    Assignment statements allow us to do all kinds of arithmetic
    operations (or rather to think of these types of operations as being
    atomic.) In actuality even a simple procedure like adding two numbers
    requires an algorithm of sorts, we'll avoid such a fine level of
    detail. Assignments consist of evaluating some (possibly quite
    complicated) formula in the inputs and local variables and assigning
    that value to some local variable. The two uses of the phrase “local
    variable” in the previous sentence do not need to be distinct, thus
    \(x = x + 1\) is a perfectly legal assignment.
