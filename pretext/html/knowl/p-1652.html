    We mentioned earlier in this chapter that the cardinality of \(\Naturals\) is
    denoted \(\aleph_0\). The fact that that capital letter aleph is wearing a
    subscript ought to make you wonder what other aleph-sub-something-or-others
    there are out there. What is \(\aleph_1\)? What about \(\aleph_2\)? Cantor
    presumed that there was a sequence of cardinal numbers (which is itself, of course, infinite) that give all of the possible infinities. The smallest infinite set that anyone seems to be able to imagine is \(\Naturals\), so Cantor called
    that cardinality \(\aleph_0\). What ever the “next” infinite cardinal is, is
    called \(\aleph_1\). It's conceivable that there actually isn't a “next” infinite cardinal after \(\aleph_0\) — it might be the case that the collection of
    infinite cardinal numbers isn't well-ordered! In any case, if there <!--Style me with CSS--><em>is</em> a
    “next” infinite cardinal, what is it? Cantor's theorem shows that there is
    a way to build <!--Style me with CSS--><em>some</em> infinite cardinal bigger than \(\aleph_0\) — just
    apply the power set construction. The continuum hypothesis just says that this
    bigger cardinality that we get by applying the power set construction <!--Style me with CSS--><em>is</em> that “next” cardinality we've been talking about.
