    In <a href="sec_eq_rel.html" alt="Section 6.3 Equivalence relations" title="Section 6.3 Equivalence relations">Section 6.3</a> we introduced the idea of a graph. This
    notion was first used by  Leonhard Euler to solve
    a recreational math problem posed by the citizens of
    Königsberg, Prussia (this is the city now known
    as  Kaliningrad, Russia.) Königsberg was situated
    at a place where two branches of the  Pregel river<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-48" id="fn-48"><span class="footnote"><sup> 2 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-48" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">Today, this river is known as the Pregolya.</span></span> come together — there is also
    a large island situated near this confluence. By Euler's time, the city of
    Königsberg covered this island as well as the north and south banks of the
    river and also the promontory where the branches came together. A network of
    seven bridges had been constructed to connect all these land masses. The
    townsfolk are alleged to have become enthralled by the question of whether it
    was possible to leave one's home and take a walk through town
    which crossed each of the bridges exactly once and, finally, return to one's
    home.
