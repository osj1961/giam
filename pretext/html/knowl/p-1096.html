    A <!--Style me with CSS--><em>relation</em> in mathematics is a symbol that can be placed between
    two numbers (or variables) to create a logical statement (or open sentence).
    The main point here is that the insertion of a relation symbol between
    two numbers creates a statement whose value is either true or false.
    For example, we have previously seen the divisibility symbol (\(\mid\)) and noted
    the common error of mistaking it for the division symbol (\(/\)); one of these
    tells us to perform an arithmetic operation, the other asks us whether
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>if</em> such an operation were performed there would be a remainder.
    There are many other symbols that we have seen which have this characteristic,
    the most important is probably \(=\), but there are lots: \(\neq\), \(\lt\), \(\leq\),
    \(&gt;\), \(\geq\) all work this way â€” if we place them between two numbers
    we get a Boolean thing, it's either true or false. If, instead of numbers,
    we think of placing sets on either side of a relation symbol, then
    \(=\), \(\subseteq\) and \(\supseteq\) are valid relation symbols. If we think
    of placing logical expressions on either side of a relation then,
    honestly, <!--Style me with CSS--><em>any</em> of the logical symbols is a relation, but we normally
    think of \(\land\) and \(\lor\) as operators and give things like \(\equiv\),
    \(\implies\) and \(\iff\) the status of relations.
