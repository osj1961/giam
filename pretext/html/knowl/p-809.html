          Prove that the set of perfect fourth powers is contained in the
          set of perfect squares.

          \hint{It would probably be helpful to have precise definitions of the sets described in the problem.

          The fourth powers are
          \begin{equation*}
            F = \{x \suchthat \exists y \in \Integers, x=y^4 \}.
          \end{equation*}
          The squares are
          \begin{equation*}
            S = \{x \suchthat \exists z \in \Integers, x=z^2 \}.
          \end{equation*}
          To show that one set is contained in another, we need to show that the first set's membership
          criterion implies that of the second set.}
