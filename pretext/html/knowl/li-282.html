          Lagrange's theorem on representation of integers as sums of squares
          says that every positive integer can be expressed as the sum of at most 
          \(4\) squares.  For example, \(79 = 7^2 + 5^2 + 2^2 + 1^2\).  Show (exhaustively) 
          that \(15\) can not be represented using fewer than \(4\) squares.

          \hint{Note that \(15 = 3^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 + 1^2\).  Also, if \(15\) were expressible as a sum of fewer than \(4\) squares, the squares involved would be \(1\), \(4\) and \(9\).  It's really not that hard to try all the possibilities.}
