        There is a graph \(C_5\) which consists of 5 nodes connected in a circular
        fashion. Determine its pebbling number. Prove your answer exhaustively.
      </p>
<p id="p-706">
        Hint: the pebbling number must be greater than 4 because if one pebble is
        placed on each of 4 nodes the configuration is unmovable (we need to
        have two pebbles on a node in order to be able to make a pebbling move
        at all) and so the 5th node can never be reached.
