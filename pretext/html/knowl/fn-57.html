</h5>This theorem has been 
    known for many years as the Schröder-Bernstein theorem, but, 
    lately, has had Cantor's name added as well. Since Cantor proved 
    the result before the other gentlemen this is fitting. It is also 
    known as the Cantor-Bernstein theorem (leaving out Schröder) 
    which doesn't seem very nice.</span><span class="incontext"><a href="section-42.html#fn-57">in-context</a></span>
