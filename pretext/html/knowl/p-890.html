    Let's put all this together. The inclusion \(B \subseteq A\) corresponds
    to the logical sentence \(M_B \implies M_A\). We know that implications
    are equivalent to OR statements, so \(M_B \implies M_A \, \cong \, 
    {\lnot}M_B \lor M_A\). The notion that the region we've
    indicated above is empty is written as \(\overline{A} \cap B \, = \, \emptyset\),
    in logical terms this is \({\lnot}M_A \land M_B \, \cong \, c\).
    Finally, we apply DeMorgan's law and a commutation to get
    \({\lnot}M_B \lor M_A \, \cong \, t\). You should take note of the
    convention that when you see a logical sentence just written on the
    page (as is the case with \(M_B \implies M_A\) in the first sentence
    of this paragraph) what's being asserted is that the sentence is
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>universally true</em>.
    Thus, writing \(M_B \implies M_A\) is the same thing as writing
    \(M_B \implies M_A \, \cong \, t\).
