    Once we have an infinite list containing every real number in the interval
    \((0, 1)\) we have to face up to a second issue. What does it really mean
    to list a particular real number? For instance if \(e-2\) is in the seventh
    position on our list, is it OK to write “\(e-2\)” there or should we write
    “0.7182818284590452354…”? Clearly it would be simpler to write
    “\(e-2\)” but it isn't necessarily possible to do something of that kind
    for every real
    number — on the other hand, writing down the decimal expansion is a problem
    too; in a certain sense, “most” real numbers in (0, 1) have infinitely long
    decimal expansions. There is also another problem with decimal expansions;
    they aren't unique. For example, there is really no difference between the
    finite expansion \(0.5\) and the infinitely long expansion \(0.4\overline{9}\).
