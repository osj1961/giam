    So far we've been discussing proofs quite a bit, but have paid
    very little attention to a really huge issue. If the statements
    we are attempting to prove are false, no proof is ever going to
    be possible. Really, a prerequisite to developing a facility with
    proofs is developing a good “lie detector.” We need to be able
    to guess, or quickly ascertain, whether a statement is true or false.
    If we are given a universally quantified statement the first thing to
    do is try it out for some random elements of the universe we're working
    in. If we happen across a value that satisfies the statement's hypotheses
    but doesn't satisfy the conclusion, we've found what is known as a
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>counterexample</em>.
