    The graph of Königsberg has 4 nodes: one of degree 5 and three of degree
    3. All the nodes are odd. Would it be possible to either modify
    Königsberg or come up with an entirely new graph having some even nodes?
    Well, the answer to that is easy — just tear down one of the bridges, and two
    of the nodes will have their degree changed by one; they'll both become even.
    Notice that, by removing one edge, we effected the parity of two nodes. Is
    it possible to create a graph with four nodes in which just one of them is
    even? More generally, given any short list of natural numbers, is it
    possible to draw a graph whose degrees are the listed numbers?
