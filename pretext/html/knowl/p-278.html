<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>
          The famous logician  Raymond Smullyan devised 
          a family of logical puzzles around a fictitious place he called 
           “the Island of Knights and Knaves.”  The inhabitants of the island are either knaves, who always make false statements, or knights, who always make truthful statements.  

          In the most famous knight/knave puzzle, you are in a room which has only two exits.  One leads to certain death and the other to freedom.  There are two 
          individuals in the room, and you know that one of them is a knight and the other is a knave, but you don't know which.   Your challenge is to determine the door which leads to freedom by asking a single question.

          \hint{Ask one of them what the other one would say to do.}
