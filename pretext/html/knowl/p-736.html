    Now, before we can prove this result, we'll need a precise definition
    for \(\gcd{a}{b}\). Firstly, a gcd must be a <!--Style me with CSS--><em>common divisor</em> which
    means it needs to divide both \(a\) and \(b\). Secondly, among all the common
    divisors, it must be the <!--Style me with CSS--><em>largest</em>. This second point is usually
    addressed
    by requiring that every other common divisor divides the gcd. Finally we
    should note that a gcd is always positive, for whenever a number divides
    another number so does its negative, and whichever of those two is positive
    will clearly be the greater! This allows us to extend the definition of
    gcd to all integers, but things are conceptually easier if we
    keep our attention restricted to the positive integers.
