    Suppose we have two sets \(A\) and \(B\) and we're interested
    in proving that \(B \subseteq A\). The job is done if we can show that
    all of \(B\)'s elements are actually in the eye-shaped region that represents
    the intersection \(A \cap B\). It's equivalent if we can show that the
    region marked with \(\emptyset\) in the following diagram is actually empty.
