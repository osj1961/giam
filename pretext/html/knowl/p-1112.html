    Then, for example, because \((e,t) \in \relR\) we can write \(e \relR t\). We indicate the
    negation of the concept that two elements are related by drawing a slash
    through the name of the relation, for example the notation \(\neq\) is certainly
    familiar to you, as is \(\nless\) (although in this latter case we
    would normally write \(\geq\) instead). We can denote the fact that
    \((a,l)\) is not a pair that makes the relation true by writing \(a \nrelR l\).
