    There is no Nobel prize category for mathematics.<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-28" id="fn-28"><span class="footnote"><sup> 1 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-28" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">There are prizes
    considered equivalent to the Nobel in stature — the Fields Medal, awarded every four years by the International Mathematical Union to up to four mathematical researchers under the age of forty, and the Abel Prize, awarded annually by the King of Norway.</span></span> Alfred Nobel's will
    called for the awarding of annual prizes in physics, chemistry, physiology
    or medicine, literature, and peace. Later, the
    “Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel”
    was created and certainly several mathematicians have won what is
    improperly known as the Nobel prize in Economics. But, there is no
    Nobel prize in Mathematics per se. There is an interesting urban myth that
    purports to explain this lapse: Alfred Nobel's wife either left him for, or
    had an affair with a mathematician — so Nobel, the inventor of dynamite
    and an immensely wealthy and powerful man, when he decided to endow
    a set of annual prizes for “those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind” pointedly left out mathematicians.
