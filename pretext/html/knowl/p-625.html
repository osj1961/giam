          Show that if \(x\) is a positive real number, then \(x+\frac{1}{x} \geq 2\). 

          \hint{If you work backwards from the conclusion on this one, you should eventually come to the inequality \((x-1)^2 \geq 0\).  Notice that this inequality is always true — all squares are non-negative. When you go to write-up your proof (writing things in the forward direction), you'll want to acknowledge this truth. Start with something like “Regardless of the value of \(x\), the quantity \((x-1)^2\) is greater than or equal to zero as it is a perfect square.”}
