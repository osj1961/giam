    Regarding <!--Style me with CSS--><em>true</em> and <!--Style me with CSS--><em>false</em>, we hope there is no uncertainty
    as to their meanings. <!--Style me with CSS--><em>Sentence</em> also has a well-understood
    meaning that most will agree on — a syntactically correct ordered collection
    of words such as “Johnny was a football player.” or “Red is a color.”
    or “This is a sentence which does not refer to itself.” A <!--Style me with CSS--><em>statement</em>
    is a sentence which is either true or false.
    In other words, a statement
    is a sentence whose truth value is <!--Style me with CSS--><em>definite</em>, in more other words,
    it is always possible to decide — one way or the other — whether
    a statement is true or false.<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-10" id="fn-10"><span class="footnote"><sup> 2 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-10" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">Although, as a practical matter
    it may be almost impossibly difficult to do so!  For instance it is 
    certainly either true or false that I ate eggs for breakfast on my 21st
    birthday — but I don't remember, and short of building a time machine,
    I don't know how you could find out.</span></span> The first example
    of a sentence given above (“Johnny was a football player”) is not a
    statement — the problem is that it is ambiguous unless we know who
    Johnny is. If it had said “Johnny Unitas was a football player.” then
    it would have been a statement. If it had said “Johnny Appleseed was a
    football player.” it would also have been a statement, just not a true one.
