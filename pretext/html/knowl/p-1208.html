    The concept of a function is one of the most useful abstractions
    in mathematics. In fact it is an abstraction that can be further
    abstracted! For instance an <!--Style me with CSS--><em>operator</em>
    is an entity which takes functions as inputs and produces functions
    as outputs, thus an operator is to functions as functions themselves
    are to numbers. There are many operators that you have certainly
    encountered already — just not by that name. One of the most
    famous operators is “differentiation,” when you take the derivative
    of some function, the answer you obtain is another function.
    If two different people are given the same differentiation problem
    and they come up with different answers, we <!--Style me with CSS--><em>know</em> that at least
    one of them has made a mistake! Similarly, if two calculations of the
    value of a function are made for the same input, they <!--Style me with CSS--><em>must</em> match.
