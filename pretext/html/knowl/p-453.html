    A similar notation exists for disjunctions. Purely as an example, consider
    the following problem from recreational math: Find a four digit number that
    is an integer multiple of its reversal. (By reversal, we mean the four
    digit number with the digits in the opposite order — for example, the
    reversal of 1234 is 4321.) The sentence<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-16" id="fn-16"><span class="footnote"><sup> 2 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-16" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">This sentence uses what 
    is commonly referred to as an “abuse of notation” in order avoid an 
    unnecessarily complex problem statement.  One should not necessarily 
    avoid such abuses if one's readers can be expected to easily understand 
    what is meant, any more than one should completely eschew the splitting 
    of infinitives.</span></span>
    that states that this question has a solution is
    \begin{equation*}
      \exists abcd \in {\mathbb Z},  \exists k \in {\mathbb Z}, abcd = k\cdot dcba
    \end{equation*}
