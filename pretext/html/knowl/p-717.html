    From a certain point of view, there is no need for the current section.
    If we are proving an existential statement we are <!--Style me with CSS--><em>disproving</em> some
    universal statement. (Which has already been discussed.) Similarly,
    if we are trying to disprove an existential statement, then we are
    actually <!--Style me with CSS--><em>proving</em> a related universal statement. Nevertheless,
    sometimes the way a theorem is stated emphasizes the existence question
    over the corresponding universal â€” and so people talk about proving
    and disproving existential statements as a separate issue from
    universal statements.
