    Hopefully these examples are relatively self-evident. Unfortunately, that
    very self-evidence may tend to make you think that this notion of equivalence
    isn't all that interesting — nothing could be further from the truth! The
    notion of equivalence of sets becomes really interesting when we study infinite
    sets. Once we have the right definition in hand we will be able to prove
    some truly amazing results. For instance, the sets \(\Naturals\) and \(\Rationals\) turn out to be equivalent. Since the naturals are wholly contained in the rationals this is (to say the least) counter-intuitive! Coming up with the “right” definition for this concept is crucial.
