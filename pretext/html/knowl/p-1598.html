    To show that some pair of sets are not equivalent it is necessary to show
    that there cannot be a one-to-one correspondence between them. Ordinarily,
    one would try to argue by contradiction in such a situation. That is what
    we'll need to do to show that the reals and the naturals are not equinumerous.
    We'll presume that they are in fact the same size and try to reach a
    contradiction.
