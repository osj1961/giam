    Traditionally, the laws we've just stated would be called
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>left</em>-distributive laws and we would also need to state
    that there are <!--Style me with CSS--><em>right</em>-distributive laws that apply. Since,
    in the current setting, we have already said that the commutative
    law is valid, this isn't really necessary.
