        Note that this truth table is similar to the truth table for
        \(A \lor B\) in that there is only a single row having a \(\phi\) in
        the last column. For \(A \lor B\) the \(\phi\) occurs in the 4th row
        and for \(A \implies B\) it occurs in the 2nd row. This suggests
        that by suitably modifying things (replacing \(A\) or \(B\) by their
        negations) we could come up with an “or” statement that had the
        same meaning as the conditional. Try it!
