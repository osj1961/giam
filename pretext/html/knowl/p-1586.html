    There are other geometric constructions which we can use to show that
    there are the same number of points in a variety of entities. For example,
    consider the upper half of the unit circle (Remember the unit circle from
    Trig? All points \((x, y)\) satisfying \(x^2 + y^2 = 1\).) This is a
    semi-circle having a radius of 1, so the arclength of said semi-circle
    is \(\pi\). It isn't hard to imagine
    that this semi-circular arc contains the same number of points as an interval
    of length \(\pi\), and we've already argued that all intervals contain the same
    number of points… But, a nice example of geometric projection —
    vertical projection (a.k.a. \(\pi_1\)) — can be used to show that
    (for example) the interval
    \((-1, 1)\) and the portion of the unit circle lying in the upper
    half-plane are equinumerous.
