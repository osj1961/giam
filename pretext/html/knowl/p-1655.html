<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>
    Having reached this stage in a book about proving things I hope that the
    last two sentences in the previous paragraph caused some thought along the
    lines of “well, ok, with respect to what axioms?” to run through your
    head. So, if you did think something along those lines pat yourself on the
    back. And if you <!--Style me with CSS--><em>didn't</em> then recognize that you need to start thinking
    that way — things are proved or disproved only in a relative way, it depends
    what axioms you allow yourself to work with. The usual axioms for mathematics
    are called ZFC; the Zermelo-Frankel set theory axioms together with the
    axiom of choice. The “ultimate weirdness” we've been describing about
    the continuum hypothesis is a result due to a gentleman named  Paul Cohen that says “CH is independent of ZFC.” More pedantically — it is impossible to either prove or disprove the continuum hypothesis within
    the framework of the ZFC axiom system.
