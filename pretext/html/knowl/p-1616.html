    Cantor's theorem guarantees that there is an infinite hierarchy of infinite
    cardinal numbers. Let's put it another way. People have sought a construction
    that, given an infinite set, could be used to create a strictly larger set.
    For
    instance, the Cartesian product works like this if our sets are finite —
    \(A \times A\) is strictly bigger than \(A\) when \(A\) is a finite set. But, as
    we've already seen,
    this is not necessarily so if \(A\) is infinite (remember the “snake” argument
    that \(\Naturals\) and \(\Naturals \times \Naturals\) are equivalent). The
    real import of Cantor's theorem is that taking the power set of a set
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>does</em> create a set of larger cardinality.
    So we get an infinite tower of infinite cardinalities, starting with
    \(\aleph_0 = |\Naturals|\), by successively taking power sets.
    \begin{equation*}
      \aleph_0  = |\Naturals| \lt  |{\mathcal P}(\Naturals)| \lt  |{\mathcal P}({\mathcal P}(\Naturals))| \lt  |{\mathcal P}({\mathcal P}({\mathcal P}(\Naturals)))| \lt  \ldots
    \end{equation*}
