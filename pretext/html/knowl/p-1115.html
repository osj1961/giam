    Eventually, we will get around to defining functions as relations that
    have a certain nice property. For the moment, we'll just note that
    some of the operations that you are used to using with functions
    also apply with relations. When one function “undoes” what another
    function “does” we say the functions are inverses. For example,
    the function \(f(x)=2x\) (i.e. doubling) and the function \(g(x)=x/2\) (halving)
    are inverse functions because, no matter what number we start with, if we
    double it and then halve that result, we end up with the original number.
    The inverse of a relation \(\relR\) is written \(\relR^{-1}\) and it consists of
    the reversals of the pairs in \(\relR\),
    \begin{equation*}
      \relR^{-1} = \{ (b,a) \suchthat (a,b) \in \relR \}.
    \end{equation*}
