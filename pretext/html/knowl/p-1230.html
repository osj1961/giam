    The graph that we obtain by reflecting \(y=f(x)=x^2\) in the line \(y=x\) doesn't
    pass the vertical line test and so it is the graph of (merely) a relation — not of a function. The function \(g(x) = \sqrt{x}\) that we all know
    and love is not truly the inverse of \(f(x)\). In fact this function is
    defined to make a specific (and natural) choice — it returns the positive
    square root of a number. But this leads to a subtle problem; if we start
    with a negative number (say \(-3\)) and square it we get a positive number (\(9\))
    and if we then come along and take the square root we get another positive
    number (\(3\)). This is problematic since we didn't end up where we started
    which is what ought to happen if we apply a function followed by its inverse.
