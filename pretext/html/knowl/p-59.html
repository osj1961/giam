    Prime numbers act as multiplicative building blocks for the rest of
    the integers. When we disassemble an integer into its building blocks
    we are finding the <!--Style me with CSS--><em>prime factorization</em>
    of that number. Prime
    factorizations are unique. That is, a number is either prime or it
    has prime factors (possibly raised to various powers) that are
    uniquely determined â€” except that they may be re-ordered.
