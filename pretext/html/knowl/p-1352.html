    If we were playing a card game in which we were dealt 5 cards from
    a deck of 52, we would receive our cards in the form of
    \(P(52,5) = 52 \cdot 51 \cdot 50 \cdot 49 \cdot 48 = 311875200\) ordered
    \(5\)-tuples. Normally, we don't really care about what order the cards
    came to us in. In a card game one ordinarily begins sorting the cards
    so as to see what hand one has â€” this is a sure sign that the order the
    cards were dealt is actually immaterial. How many different orders can
    five cards be put in? The answer to this question is \(5! = 120\) since
    what we are discussing is nothing more than a permutation of a set of
    size 5. Thus, if we say that there are 311,875,200 different possible
    hands in 5-card poker, we are over-counting things by quite a bit! Any
    given hand will appear 120 times in that tabulation, which means the
    right value is \(311875200/120 = 2598960\).
