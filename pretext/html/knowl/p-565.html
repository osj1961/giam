    This seems like a good time to make a comment on polynomial arithmetic.
    
    Many people give up (or go searching for a computer algebra system)
    when dealing with products of anything bigger than binomials. This
    is a shame because there is an easy method using a table for performing
    such multiplications. As an example, in devising the previous proof we
    needed to form the product \(a(a+1)(a+2)(a+3)\), now we can use the
    distributive law or the infamous F.O.I.L rule to multiply pairs of these,
    but we still need to multiply \((a^2+a)\) with \((a^2+5a+6)\). Create a
    table that has the terms of these two polynomials as its row and column
    headings.
