    Okay, so this outline is pretty crappy. It tells you how to start and
    end a direct proof, but those obnoxious dot-dot-dots in the middle are
    where all the real work has to go. If I could tell you (even in outline)
    how to fill in those dots, that would mean mathematical proof isn't really
    a very interesting activity to engage in. Filling in those dots will
    sometimes (rarely) be obvious, more often it will be extremely challenging;
    it will require great creativity, loads of concentration, you'll call on
    all your previous mathematical experiences, and you will most likely
    experience a certain degree of anguish. Just remember that your sense
    of accomplishment is proportional to the difficulty of the puzzles you
    attempt. So let's attempt anotherâ€¦
