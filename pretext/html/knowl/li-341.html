          Venn diagrams are usually made using simple closed curves 
          with no further restrictions.  Try creating Venn diagrams for 3, 4 and
          5 sets (in general position) using rectangular simple closed curves.

          \hint{I found it easier to experiment by making my drawings on graph paper.  I never did  
          manage to draw the \(5\) set Venn diagram with just rectanglesâ€¦ probably just a lack of persistence.}
