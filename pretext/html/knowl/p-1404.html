    Now it only takes 7 bits to encode the 128 possible values in the
    ASCII system, which can easily be verified by noticing that the left-most
    bits in all of the binary representations above are 0. Most computers
    use 8 bit words or “bytes” as their basic units of information, and the
    fact that the ASCII code only requires 7 bits lead someone to think up
    a use for that additional bit. It became a “parity check bit.” If the
    seven bits of an ASCII encoding have an odd number of 1's, the parity
    check bit is set to 1 — otherwise, it is set to 0. The result of this
    is that, subsequently, all of the 8 bit words that encode ASCII data will have
    an even number of 1's. This is an example of a so-called  error detecting
    code known as the “even code” or the “parity check code.” If
    data is sent over a noisy telecommunications channel, or is stored in
    fallible computer memory, there is some small but calculable probability
    that there will be a “bit error.” For instance, one computer might
    send 10000111 (which is the ASCII code that says “ring the bell”) but
    another machine across the network might receive 10100111 (the 3rd bit from
    the left has been received in error) now if we are only looking at the
    rightmost seven bits we will think that the ASCII code for a single quote
    has been received, but if we note that this piece of received data has an
    odd number of ones we'll realize that something is amiss. There are other
    more advanced coding schemes that will let us not only <!--Style me with CSS--><em>detect</em> an
    error, but (within limits) <!--Style me with CSS--><em>correct</em> it as well! This rather amazing
    feat is what makes wireless telephony (not to mention communications
    with deep space probes — whoops! I mentioned it) work.
