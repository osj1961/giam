    Complex numbers are added and multiplied as if they were binomials
    (polynomials with just two terms) where \(i\) is treated as if it were
    the variable â€” except that we use the algebraic property that \(i\)'s
    square is -1. For example, to add the complex numbers \(1+2i\) and
    \(3-6i\) we just think of the binomials \(1+2x\) and \(3-6x\). Of course we
    normally write a binomial with the term involving the variable coming
    first, but this is just a convention. The sum of those binomials
    would be \(4-4x\) and so the sum of the given complex numbers is \(4-4i\).
    This sort of operation is fairly typical and is called
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>component-wise</em> addition.
    To multiply complex numbers we have to
    recall how it is that we multiply binomials. This is the well-known
    FOIL rule (first, outer, inner, last). For example the product of
    \(3-2x\) and \(4+3x\) is \((3\cdot 4) + (3 \cdot 3x) + (-2x\cdot 4) +
    (-2x\cdot 3x)\) this expression simplifies to \(12 + x - 6x^2\). The
    analogous calculation with complex numbers looks just the same, until
    we get to the very last stage where, in simplifying, we use the fact
    that \(i^2=-1\).
    \begin{gather*}
(3-2i)\cdot (4+3i)\\
= (3\cdot 4) + (3\cdot 3i) + (-2i\cdot 4) + (-2i\cdot 3i)\\
= 12 + 9i - 8i -6i^2\\
= 12 + i + 6\\
= 18 + i
\end{gather*}
