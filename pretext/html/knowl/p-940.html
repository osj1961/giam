    This is the model one should keep in mind when thinking about PMI: domino
    toppling. In setting up a line of dominoes, what do we need to do
    in order to ensure that they will all fall when the toppling begins?
    Every domino must be placed so that it will hit and topple its successor.
    This is exactly analogous to \((a \in S \, \implies s(a) \in S)\). (Think
    of \(S\) having the membership criterion, \(x \in S\) = “\(x\) will have fallen
    when the toppling is over.”) The other thing that has to happen
    (barring the action of cockroaches) is for someone to knock over the
    first domino. This is analogous to \(0 \in S\).
