    This word “isomorphic” has a nice etymology. It means “same shape.” Two graphs are
    isomorphic if they have the same shape. We don't have the tools right now to do a formal
    proof (in fact we need to look at some further prerequisites before we can really precisely
    define isomorphism), but isomorphism of graphs is an equivalence relation. Let's at least
    verify this informally.
