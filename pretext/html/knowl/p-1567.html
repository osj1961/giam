    To many people the current topic will seem about as sensible as the schoolyard
    discussions just alluded to. We are concerned with knowing whether
    one infinite set is bigger than another, or are they the same size. There are
    generally three reasons that people disdain to consider such questions. The
    first is that, like super-heros, infinite sets are just products of the imagination.
    The second is that there can be no difference because “infinite is infinite” — once you get to the size we call infinity, you can't add something to that to
    get to a bigger infinity. The third is that the answers to questions like this
    are not going to earn me big piles of money so “who cares?”
