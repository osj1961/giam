    We'll count the man who ends up some number of steps above the
    \(x\)-axis, as well as all the pieces who get jumped and removed
    from the board as a measure of the efficiency of a strategy.
    If you did the last exercise correctly you should have found that
    eight men are the minimum required to get 3 steps into enemy
    territory. So far, the number of men required to get a given
    distance into enemy territory seems to always be a power of
    2.
