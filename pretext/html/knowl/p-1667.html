    Probably you have heard of the impossibility of trisecting an angle.
    (Hold on for a quick rant about the importance of understanding your
    hypotheses…) What's <!--Style me with CSS--><em>actually</em> true is that you can't trisect
    a generic angle if you accept the restriction of using the old-fashioned
    tools of Euclidean geometry: the compass and straight-edge. There
    are a lot of constructions that can't be done using just a
    straight-edge and compass — angle trisection, duplication of a cube<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-61" id="fn-61"><span class="footnote"><sup> 1 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-61" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">Duplicating the cube 
    is also known as the Delian problem — the problem comes from a pronouncement
    by the oracle of Apollo at Delos that a plague afflicting the Athenians would
    be lifted if they built an altar to Apollo that was twice as big as the 
    existing altar.  The existing altar was a cube, one meter on a side, so they
    carefully built a two meter cube — but the plague raged on.  Apparently what
    Apollo wanted was a cube that had double the <!--Style me with CSS--><em>volume</em> of the 
    present altar — it's side length would have to be 
    \(\sqrt[3]{2} \approx 1.25992\) and since this was Greece and it was around 
    430 B.C. and there were no electronic calculators, they were basically
    just screwed.</span></span>, squaring a circle, constructing a regular heptagon, <!--Style me with CSS--><em>et cetera</em>.
