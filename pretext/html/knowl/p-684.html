          In an exercise in <a href="sec_more.html" alt="Section 3.2 More direct proofs" title="Section 3.2 More direct proofs">SectionÂ 3.2</a> we proved that the quadratic 
          equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) has two solutions if \(ac \lt  0\).  Find a counterexample which shows that this implication cannot be replaced with a biconditional.  

          \hint{We'd want \(ac\) to be positive (so \(a\) and \(c\) have the same sign) but nevertheless have \(b^2-4ac &gt; 0\).  It seems that if we make \(b\) sufficiently large that could happen.}
