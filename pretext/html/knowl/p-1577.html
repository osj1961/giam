    The examples we've done so far have shown that the integers,
    the natural numbers and the even naturals all have the same
    cardinality. This is the first infinite cardinal number, known
    as \(\aleph_0\). In a certain sense we could view both
    of the equivalences we've shown as demonstrating that
    \(2 \cdot \infty = \infty\). Our next example will lend
    credence to the rule: \(\infty \cdot \infty = \infty\).
    The Cartesian product of two finite sets (the set of all
    ordered pairs with entries from the sets in question) has
    cardinality equal to the product of the cardinalities of
    the sets. What do you suppose will happen if we let the sets
    be infinite? For instance, what is the cardinality of
    \(\Naturals \times \Naturals\)? Consider this:
    the subset of ordered pairs that start with a 0 can be thought of as a copy
    of \(\Naturals\) sitting inside this Cartesian product. In fact
    the subset of ordered pairs
    starting with any particular number gives another copy of \(\Naturals\)
    inside \(\Naturals \times \Naturals\). There
    are infinitely many copies of \(\Naturals\) sitting inside of
    \(\Naturals \times \Naturals\)! This just really ought
    to get us to a larger cardinality. The surprising result that it
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>doesn't</em> involves an idea sometimes known as
     “Cantor's Snake” — a trick that allows
    us to list the elements of \(\Naturals \times \Naturals\) in a singly
    infinite list<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-56" id="fn-56"><span class="footnote"><sup> 2 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-56" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">Cantor's snake was originally created to show

    You can visualize the set \(\Naturals \times \Naturals\) as the
    points having integer coordinates
    in the first quadrant (together with the origin and the positive
    \(x\) and \(y\) axes).
    This set of points and the path through them known as Cantor's snake is
