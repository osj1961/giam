    The pattern of black and white squares on a chessboard is an
    example of a sort of artificial parity, if we number the squares
    of the board appropriately then the odd squares will be white and
    the even squares will be black. We are used to chessboards having
    this alternating black/white pattern on them, but nothing about these
    tiling problems required that structure<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-50" id="fn-50"><span class="footnote"><sup> 4 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-50" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">Nothing about chess
    requires this structure either, but it does let us do some error checking.
    For instance, bishops always end up on the same color they left from and 
    knights always switch colors as they move.</span></span> If we were used to monochromatic chessboards, we might never solve the previous two problems — unless
    of course we invented the coloring scheme in order to solve them.
    An odd-by-odd chessboard has more squares of one color than of the other.
    An odd-by-odd chessboard needs to have a square pruned in order for it to
    be possible for it to be tiled by dominoes — but if the wrong colored
    square is pruned it will <!--Style me with CSS--><em>still</em> be impossible. Each domino covers
    two squares — one of each color! (So the pruned board must have the
    same number of white squares as black.)
