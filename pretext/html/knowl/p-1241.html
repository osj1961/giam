      First we will show that \(f\) is surjective. Consider an arbitrary element
      \(y\) of the set \(\mathcal O\). Since \(y \in {\mathcal O}\) it follows that
      \(y\) is both positive and odd. Thus there is an integer \(k\), such that
      \(y=2k+1\), but also \(y&gt;0\). From this it follows that \(2k+1 &gt;0\) and so
      \(k &gt; -1/2\). Since \(k\) is also an integer, this last inequality implies
      that \(k \in \Znoneg\). (Recall that \(\Znoneg = \{0,1,2,3, \ldots \}\).) We can easily verify that a preimage
      for \(y\) is \(k+1\), since \(f(k+1) = 2(k+1)-1 = 2k+2-1 = 2k+1 = y\).
