    König's proof of C-B-S doesn't use the axiom of choice, but it does have
    its own strangeness: a function that is not necessarily computable — that is,
    a function for which (for certain inputs) it may not be possible to compute
    an output in a finite amount of time! Except for this oddity,
    König's proof
    is probably the easiest to understand of all the proofs of C-B-S.
    Before we get too far into the proof it is essential that we understand the
    basic setup. The Cantor-Bernstein-Schröder theorem states that
    whenever \(A\)
    and \(B\) are sets and there are injective functions
    \(f : A \longrightarrow B\) and \(g : B \longrightarrow A\),
    then it follows that \(A\) and \(B\) are equivalent. Saying \(A\) and \(B\)
    are equivalent
    means that we can find a bijective function between them. So, to prove
    C-B-S, we hypothesize the two injections and somehow we must construct the
    bijection.
