    In words, if you take the union of all the pieces of the partition you'll get the
    set \(S\), and any pair of sets from the partition that aren't identical are disjoint.
    Partitions are an inherently useful way of looking at things, although in the real world
    there are often problems (sets we thought were disjoint turn out to have elements in common,
    or we discover something that doesn't fit into any of the pieces of our partition), in
    mathematics we usually find that partitions do just what we would want them to do.
    Partitions divide some set up into a number of convenient pieces in such a way that we're
    guaranteed that every element of the set is in one of the pieces and also so that none of
    the pieces overlap. Partitions are a useful way of dissecting sets, and equivalence relations
    (via their equivalence classes) give us an easy way of creating partitions â€” usually with some additional structure to boot! The
    properties that make a relation an equivalence relation (reflexivity, symmetry and
    transitivity) are designed to ensure that equivalence classes exist and do provide us
    with the desired partition. For the beginning proof writer this all may seem very complicated,
    but take heart! Most of the work has already been done for you by those who created
    the general theory of equivalence relations and quotient structures. All you have
    to do (usually) is prove that a given relation is an equivalence relation by verifying
    that it is indeed reflexive, symmetric and transitive. Let's have a look at another
    example.
