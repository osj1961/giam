    There is a connection, perhaps obvious, between the regions we
    see in a Venn diagram with sets in general position and the recognizers
    we studied in the section on digital logic circuits. In fact both
    of these topics have to do with <!--Style me with CSS--><em>disjunctive normal form</em>. In a Venn diagram with \(k\) sets, we are seeing the universe
    of discourse broken up into the union of \(2^k\) regions each of which
    corresponds to an intersection of either one of the sets or its complement.
    An arbitrary expression involving set-theoretic symbols and these \(k\) sets
    is true in certain of these \(2^k\) regions and false in the others.
    We have put the arbitrary expression in disjunctive normal form when
    we express it as a union of the intersections that describe those regions.
