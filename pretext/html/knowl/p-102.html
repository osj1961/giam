      The notion of being even has an obvious generalization. Suppose
      we asked whether \(3\) divided evenly into a given number. Presumably
      we could make a definition of what it meant to be <!--Style me with CSS--><em>threeven</em>, but
      rather than doing so (or engaging in any further punnery) we shall
      instead move to a general definition. We need a notation for the
      situation when one number divides evenly into another. There are
      many ways to describe this situation in English, but essentially
      just one in “math,” we use a vertical bar — <!--Style me with CSS--><em>not</em> a fraction
      bar. Indeed the difference between this vertical bar and the
      fraction symbol (\(\divides\) versus \(/\)) needs to
      be strongly stressed. The vertical bar
      when placed between two numbers is a symbol which asks the question
      “Does the first number divide evenly (i.e. with no remainder) into
      the second?” On the other hand the fraction bar asks you to actually
      carry out some division. The value of \(2\divides 5\) is <!--Style me with CSS--><em>false</em>, whereas
      the value of \(2/5\) is \(.4\)
