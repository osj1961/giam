          Prove that for every real number \(x\), \(\frac{2}{3} \lt  x \lt  \frac{3}{4} \; \implies \; \lfloor 12x \rfloor = 8\).

          \hint{



          Begin your proof like so:

          “Suppose that \(x\) is a real number such that \(\frac{2}{3} \lt  x \lt  \frac{3}{4}\).”

          You need to multiply all three parts of the inequality by something in order to “clear” the fractions.
          What should that be?


          The definition for the floor of \(12x\) will be satisfied if \(8 \leq 12x \lt  9\) but unfortunately the work done 
          previously will have deduced that \(8 \lt  12x \lt  9\) is true.  Don't just gloss over this discrepancy.  Explain why
          one of these inequalities is implied by the other.
