        Find a counterexample for the conjecture that \(x^2-31x+257\) evaluates to a prime number
        whenever \(x\) is a natural number .



        \hint{Part of what makes the "prime-producing-power" of that polynomial impressive is that it gives each prime twice â€” once on the descending arm of the parabola and once on the ascending arm. In other words, the polynomial gives prime values on a set of contiguous natural numbers \(\{0,1,2, ..., N\}\) and the vertex of the parabola that is its graph lies dead in the middle of that range. You can figure out what \(N\) is by thinking about the other end of the range: \((-1)^2 + 31 \cdot (-1) + 257 = 289\) (\(289\) is not a prime, you should recognize it as a perfect square.)}
