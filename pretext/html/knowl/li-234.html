          Prove that the sum of two rational numbers is a rational number.

          \hint{



           You want to argue about the sum of two generic rational numbers. Maybe call them \(a/b\) and \(c/d\). The definition of “rational number” then tells you that \(a\), \(b\), \(c\) and \(d\) are integers and that neither \(b\) nor \(d\) are zero. You add these generic rational numbers in the usual way — put them over a common denominator and then add the numerators. One possible common denominator is \(bd\), so we can express the sum as \((ad+bc)/(bd)\).  You can finish off the argument from here: you need to show that this expression for the sum satisfies the definition of a rational number (quotient of integers w/ non-zero denominator). Also, write it all up a bit more formally…
