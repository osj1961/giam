    Counting \(k\)-permutations using the multiplication rule is easy. We
    build a \(k\)-permutation in \(k\) stages. In stage 1, we pick the first
    element in the permutation — there are \(n\) possible choices. In
    stage 2, we pick the second element — there are now only \(n-1\) choices
    since we may not repeat the first entry. We keep going like this until
    we've picked \(k\) entries. The number \(P(n,k)\) is the product of \(k\)
    numbers beginning with \(n\) and descending down to \(n-k+1\). To verify
    that \(n-k+1\) is really the right lower limit, check that there are indeed
    \(k\) entries in the sequence
    \begin{equation*}
      (n, n-1, n-2, \ldots n-k+1).
    \end{equation*}
