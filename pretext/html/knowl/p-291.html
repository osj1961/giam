    One final piece of advice about conditionals: don't confuse logical
    if-then relationships with causality. Many of the if-then sentences
    we run into in ordinary life describe cause and effect:
    “If you cut the green wire the bomb will explode.” (Okay, that one
    is an example from the ordinary life of a bomb squad technician, but …)
    It is usually best to think of the if-then relationships we find in
    Logic as divorced from the flow of time, the fact that \(A \implies B\)
    is logically the same as \({\lnot}A \lor B\) lends credence to this point of view.
