    So what about expressions involving variables and these relation symbols?
    For example what does \(x \lt  y\) really mean? Okay, I know that you know
    what \(x \lt  y\) means but, philosophically, a relation symbol involving variables
    is doing something that you may have only been vaguely aware of in the
    past — it is introducing a <!--Style me with CSS--><em>supposition</em>. Watch out for relation
    symbols involving variables! Whenever you encounter them it means the
    rules of the game are being subtly altered — up until the point where
    you see \(x \lt  y\), \(x\) and \(y\) are just two random numbers, but after that
    point we must suppose that \(x\) is the smaller of the two.
