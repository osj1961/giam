    It <!--Style me with CSS--><em>is</em> true that rhinoceroses have an instinctive desire to extinguish
    fires. Also, we can well imagine that if someone made this ridiculous
    argument that their duck must actually have been crushed by a rhino. But,
    is the conclusion that the duck was on fire justified? Not really, what
    the first part of the argument asserts is that “(on fire) implies (rhino
    stomping)” but couldn't a rhino stomp on something for other reasons?
    Perhaps the rhino was just ill-tempered. Perhaps the duck was just
    horrifically unlucky.
