        The <!--Style me with CSS--><em>conjugate</em> of a complex number is denoted with a
          superscript star, and is formed by negating the imaginary part.
          Thus if \(z = 3+ 4i\) then the conjugate of \(z\) is  \(z^\ast = 3-4i\).
          Give an argument as to why the product of a complex number and its
          conjugate is a real quantity.  (I.e. the imaginary part of
          \(z\cdot z^\ast\) is necessarily 0, no matter what complex number is
          used for \(z\).) 

        \hint{This is really easy, but be sure to do it generically. In other words, don't just use examples â€” do the calculation with variables for the real and imaginary parts of the complex number.
        }
