    Since we have been discussing primes in this section (mainly
    as an example of a concept with more than one equivalent
    definition), this seems like a reasonable time to make some
    explorations relative to prime numbers. We'll begin in the
    third century B.C.. 
    Eratosthenes of Cyrene was a Greek Mathematician and
    Astronomer who is remembered to this day for his many accomplishments.
    He was a librarian at the great library of Alexandria. He made
    measurements of the Earth's circumference and the distances of
    the Sun and Moon that were remarkably accurate, but probably his
    most remembered achievement is the “sieve” method for finding
    primes. Indeed, the sieve of Eratosthenes
    is still of importance
    in mathematical research. Basically, the sieve method consists
    of creating a very long list of natural numbers and then crossing
    off all the numbers that aren't primes (a positive integer that
    isn't 1, and isn't a prime is called <!--Style me with CSS--><em> composite</em>).
    This process
    is carried out in stages. First we circle 2 and then cross off
    every number that has 2 as a factor — thus we've identified
    2 as the first prime number and eliminated a whole bunch of numbers
    that aren't prime. The first number that hasn't been eliminated at
    this stage is 3, we circle it (indicating that 3 is the second prime
    number) and then cross off every number that has 3 as a factor. Note
    that some numbers (for example, 6 and 12) will have been crossed off
    more than once! In the third stage of the sieve process, we circle
    5, which is the smallest number that hasn't yet been crossed off, and
    then cross off all multiples of 5. The first three stages in the
    sieve method are shown in <span>&lt;&lt;Unresolved xref, reference "fig_sieve"; check spelling or use "provisional" attribute&gt;&gt;</span>.
