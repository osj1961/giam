            Either Wellington is a knave or Wellington is a knight.
          </p>
<p>
            If Wellington is a knight it follows that Bonaparte is a knight.
          </p>
<p>
            If Bonaparte is a knight then Wellington is a knave.
          </p>
<p>
            So, if Wellington is a knight then Wellington is a knave (which is impossible!)
          </p>
<p>
            Thus, Wellington is a knave.
          </p>
<p>
            Since Wellington is a knave, his statement “I would tell you that Bonaparte is a knight” is false.
          </p>
<p>
            So Wellington would in fact tell us that Bonaparte is a knave.
          </p>
<p>
            Since Wellington is a knave we conclude that Bonaparte is a knight.
          </p>
<p>
            Thus Bonaparte is a knight and Wellington is a knave (as claimed).
