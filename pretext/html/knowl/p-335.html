    Boolean algebra only has one “inverse” concept, the denial
    of a predicate (i.e. logical negation), but the equations above have analogues, as do
    the symbols \(0\) and \(1\) that appear in them. First, consider
    the Boolean expression \(A \lor {\lnot}A\). This is the logical <!--Style me with CSS--><em>or</em>
    of a statement and its exact opposite; when one is true the other is
    false and vice versa. But, the disjunction \(A \lor {\lnot}A\), is
    always true! We use the symbol \(t\) (which stands for
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>tautology</em>)
    to represent a compound sentence whose truth value is always true.
    A tautology (\(t\)) is to Boolean algebra something like a zero (\(0\))
    is to arithmetic. Similar thinking about the Boolean expression
    \(A \land {\lnot}A\) leads to the definition of the symbol \(c\) (which
    stands for <!--Style me with CSS--><em>contradiction</em>) to
    represent a sentence that is always
    false. The rules we have been discussing are known as
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>complementarity laws</em>:
    \begin{equation*}
      A \lor {\lnot}A \; \cong \; t \mbox{ and } 
      A \land {\lnot}A \; \cong \; c
    \end{equation*}
