    The first sequence is an
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>arithmetic sequence</em>.
    Arithmetic sequences
    are characterized by the property that the difference between successive
    terms is a constant. The second sequence is a
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>geometric sequence</em>.
    Geometric sequences have the property that the ratio of successive terms
    is a constant. The blank in the first sequence should be filled with the
    arithmetic mean of the surrounding entries \((23+37)/2 = 30\). The blank
    in the second sequence should be filled using the
    geometric mean
    of <!--Style me with CSS--><em>its</em> surrounding entries: \(\sqrt{24\cdot 96} = 48\).
