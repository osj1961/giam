    The word “argument” has a negative connotation for many people because
    it seems to have to do with <!--Style me with CSS--><em>disagreement</em>. Arguments within mathematics
    (as well as many other scholarly areas), while they may be impassioned, should
    not involve discord. A mathematical argument is a sequence of logically
    connected statements designed to produce <!--Style me with CSS--><em>agreement</em> as to the validity
    of a proposition. This “design” generally follows one of two possibilities,
    inductive reasoning or deductive reasoning. In an inductive argument
    a long list of premises is presented whose truths are considered to be
    apparent to all, each of which provides evidence that the desired conclusion
    is true. So an inductive argument represents a kind of statistical thing,
    you have all these statements that are true each of which indicates that
    the conclusion is most likely true… A strong inductive argument
    amounts to what attorneys call a “preponderance of the evidence.”
    Occasionally
    a person who has been convicted of a crime based on a preponderance of the
    evidence is later found to be innocent. This usually happens when new evidence
    is discovered that incontrovertibly proves (i.e. shows through deductive
    means) that he or she cannot be guilty. In a nutshell: inductive arguments
    can be wrong.
