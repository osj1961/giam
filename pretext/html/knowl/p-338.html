    In mathematics the word <!--Style me with CSS--><em>idempotent</em> is used to describe situations where
    a power of a thing may be equal to that thing. For example, because \((-1)^3 = -1\), we say that \(-1\) is an idempotent. Both of the Boolean operations
    have idempotence relations that just always work (regardless of the operand).
    In ordinary algebra idempotents are very rare (\(0\), \(1\) and \(-1\) are the only
    ones that come to mind), but in Boolean algebra <!--Style me with CSS--><em>every</em> statement
    is equivalent to its square â€” where the square of \(A\) can be interpreted
    either as \(A \land A\) or as \(A \lor A\).
    \begin{equation*}
      A \lor A \cong A \mbox{ and } 
      A \land A \cong A
    \end{equation*}
