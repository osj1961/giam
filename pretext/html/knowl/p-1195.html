    Two graphs are said to be  <!--Style me with CSS--><em>isomorphic</em> if they
    represent the same connections. There must first of all be a one-to-one correspondence
    between the vertices of the two graphs, and further, a pair of vertices in one
    graph are connected by some number of edges if and only if the corresponding vertices in the other graph
    are connected by the same number of edges.
