    We've already seen that an interval is equivalent to the entire
    real line but the notion that the entire infinite Cartesian plane has no more
    points in it than an interval one inch long defies our intuition. Our conception
    of dimensionality leads us to think that things of higher dimension must be
    larger than those of lower dimension. This preconception is false as we can see
    by demonstrating that a \(1 \times 1\) square can be put in one-to-one correspondence
    with the unit interval.
    Let \(S = \{ (x, y) \suchthat 0 \lt  x \lt  1 \land  0 \lt  y \lt  1 \}\) and let \(I\) be
    the open unit interval \((0, 1)\). We can use the Cantor-Bernstein-Schroeder
    theorem to show that \(S\) and \(I\) are equinumerous — we just need to find
    injections from \(I\) to \(S\) and vice versa. Given an element \(r\) in \(I\) we
    can map it injectively to the point \((r, r)\) in \(S\). To go in the other
    direction, consider a point \((a, b)\) in \(S\)
    and write out the decimal expansions of \(a\) and \(b\):
    \begin{equation*}
      a = 0.a_1a_2a_3a_4a_5\ldots
    \end{equation*}
    \begin{equation*}
      b = 0.b_1b_2b_3b_4b_5\ldots
    \end{equation*}
    as usual, if there are two decimal expansions for \(a\) and/or \(b\) we
    will make a consistent choice — say the infinite one.
