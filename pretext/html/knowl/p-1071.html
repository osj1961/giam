    If we think of a “race” between the sequences \(n^2\) and \(2^n\), notice
    that \(2^n\) starts out with the lead. The two sequences are tied when
    \(n=2\). Briefly, \(n^2\) goes into the lead but they are tied again when
    \(n=4\). After that it would appear that \(2^n\) recaptures the lead for good.
    Of course we're making a rather broad presumption — is it really true
    that \(n^2\) never catches up with \(2^n\) again? Well, if we're right
    then the following theorem should be provable:
