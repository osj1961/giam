    Notice the use of indentation in the pseudocode example to indicate
    the statements that are executed if the Boolean expression is true.
    These examples also highlight the difference between the two senses
    that the word “equals” (and the symbol \(=\)) has. In the Boolean
    expression the sense is that of <!--Style me with CSS--><em>testing</em> equality, in the
    assignment statements (as the name implies) an <!--Style me with CSS--><em>assignment</em> is
    being made. In many programming languages this distinction is made
    explicit, for instance in the C language equality testing is done via
    the symbol “==” whereas assignment is done using a single equals
    sign (\(=\)). In Mathematics the equals sign usually indicates equality
    testing, when the assignment sense is desired the word “let” will
    generally precede the equality.
