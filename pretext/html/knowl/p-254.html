    Let's start with an example. Suppose I come up to you in some windowless
    room and make the statement: “The sun is shining but it's raining!”
    You decide to investigate my claim and determine its veracity. Upon
    reaching a room that has a view of the exterior there are four possible
    combinations of sunniness and/or precipitation that you may find. That is,
    the atomic predicates “The sun is shining” and “It is raining” can each
    be true or false independently of one another. In the following table
    we introduce a convention used throughout the remainder of this book — that true is indicated with a capital letter T and false is indicated
    with the Greek letter \(\phi\) (which is basically a Greek F, and is a lot harder
    to mistake for a T than an F is.)
