      The famous mathematician
       Paul Erdös is said to have believed that
      God has a Book in which all the really elegant proofs are written.
      The greatest praise that a collaborator<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-59" id="fn-59"><span class="footnote"><sup> 1 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-59" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">The collaborators
      of Paul Erdös were legion.  His collaborators, and their collaborators,
      and <!--Style me with CSS--><em>their</em> collaborators, etc. are organized into a tree structure 
      according to their so-called Erdös number,

      was that they had discovered a “Book proof.” It is not
      easy or straightforward for a mere mortal to come up with a Book
      proof but notice that, since the Book is inaccessible to the living,
      all the Book proofs of which we are aware were constructed by ordinary
      human beings. In other words, it's not impossible!
