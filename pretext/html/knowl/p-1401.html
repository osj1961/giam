    This section is concerned with two very powerful elements of the
    proof-making arsenal: “Parity” is a way of referring to the result of
    an even/odd calculation; Counting arguments most often take the form of
    counting some collection in two different ways — and then comparing
    those results. These techniques have little to do with one another,
    but when they are applicable they tend to produce really elegant little
    arguments.
