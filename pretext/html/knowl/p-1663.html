      The title of this final chapter is intended to be whimsical â€” there
      is no real magic involved in any of the arguments that we'll look at.
      Nevertheless, if you reflect a bit on the mental processes that
      must have gone into the development of these elegant proofs, perhaps
      you'll agree that there is something magical there.
