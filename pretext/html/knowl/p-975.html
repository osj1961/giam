    A really industrious author might also include the sum of the
    fourth powers. Jacob Bernoulli (a truly industrious individual)
    got excited enough to find formulas for the sums of the first
    ten powers of the naturals. Actually, Bernoulli went much further. His work
    on sums of powers lead to the definition of what are now known as Bernoulli
    numbers and let him calculate \(\sum_{j=1}^{1000}j^{10}\) in
    about seven minutes — long before the advent of calculators! In <a knowl="./knowl/struik.html" knowl-id="xref-struik" alt="Bibliographic Entry 16 " title="Bibliographic Entry 16 ">[16]</a>, Bernoulli is
