    So, how many different outcomes
    are there when one rolls five dice? To answer this question it will
    be helpful to think about how we might express such an outcome.
    Since order is unimportant, we can choose to put the numbers that appear
    on the individual die in whatever order we like. We may as well place them
    in increasing order. There will be 5 numbers and each number is between 1
    and 6. We can list the outcomes systematically by starting with an all-ones
