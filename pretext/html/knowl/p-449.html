    Fermat probably computed that \(F_5=4294967297\), and we can well imagine
    that he checked that this number was not divisible by any small primes.
    Of course, this was well before the development of effective computing
    machinery, so we shouldn't blame Fermat for not noticing that
    \(4294967297 = 641 \cdot 6700417\). This remarkable feat of factoring
    can be replicated in seconds on a modern computer, however it was done
    first by  Leonhard Euler in 1732!
    There is quite a lot of literature
    concerning the primeness and/or compositeness of Fermat numbers. So
    far, all the Fermat numbers between \(F_5\) and \(F_{32}\) (inclusive) have
    been shown to be composite. One might be tempted to conjecture that
    only the first five Fermat numbers are prime, however this temptation
    should be resisted â€¦
