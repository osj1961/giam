    In Logic we had “sentences” and “statements,” the latter were
    distinguished as having definite truth values. The corresponding
    thing in Set theory is that sets have the property that we can always
    tell whether a given object is or is not in them. If it ever becomes
    necessary to talk about “sets” where we're not really sure what's in
    them we'll use the term <!--Style me with CSS--><em>collection</em>.
