    Two invalid forms are usually singled out for criticism, the
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>converse error</em> and the
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>inverse error</em>. In some sense
    these two apparently different ways to screw up are really the same thing.
    Just as a conditional statement and its contrapositive are known to be
    equivalent, so too are the other related statements — the
    converse and the inverse — equivalent. The converse error consists of
    mistaking the implication in a modus ponens form for its converse.
