    Now, notice that the sum \(a+b+c\) must be \(\pi/3\). This is an
    immediate consequence of \(A+B+C=\pi\) which is true for any triangle
    in the plane. It follows that by distributing two stars amongst
    the three numbers \(a\), \(b\) and \(c\) we will come up with three
    quantities which sum to \(\pi\). In other words, there are
    Euclidean triangles having the following
    triples as their vertex angles:
