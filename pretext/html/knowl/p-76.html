    It is often the case that we want to prove statements that
    assert something is true for <!--Style me with CSS--><em>every</em> element of a set.
    For example, “Every number has an additive inverse.”
    You should note that the truth of that statement is relative,
    it depends on what is meant by “number.” If we are talking
    about natural numbers it is clearly false: 3's additive
    inverse isn't in the set under consideration. If we are
    talking about integers or any of the other sets we've considered,
    the statement is true. A statement that begins with the English
    words “every” or “all” is called 
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>universally quantified</em>.
    It is asserted that the statement holds for <!--Style me with CSS--><em>everything</em> within
    some universe. It is probably clear that when we are making
    statements asserting that a thing has an additive inverse, we
    are not discussing human beings or animals or articles of clothing — we are talking about objects that it is reasonable to add together:
    numbers of one sort or another. When being careful — and we should always
    strive to be careful! — it is important to make explicit what
    universe (known as the <!--Style me with CSS--><em>universe of discourse</em>) the objects
    we are discussing come from. Furthermore, we need to distinguish
    between statements that assert that everything in the universe of
    discourse has some property, and statements that say something
    about a few (or even just one) of the elements of our universe.
    Statements of the latter sort are called 
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>existentially quantified</em>.
