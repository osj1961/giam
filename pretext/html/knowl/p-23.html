    Presumably, we could also use “nonpos” as a superscript to indicate
    non-positive integers, but this never seems to come up in practice.
    Also, you should note that \(\Integers^+\) is really the same thing
    as \(\Naturals\), but that \(\Znoneg\) is different because it
    contains \(0\).
