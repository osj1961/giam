    All of the statements discussed in the previous sections were of the
    “completely unambiguous” sort; that is, they didn't have any <!--Style me with CSS--><em>unknowns</em>
    in them. As a reader of this text, it's a sure bet that you've mastered
    Algebra and are firmly convinced of the utility of \(x\) and \(y\). Admittedly,
    we've used variables to refer to sentences (or sentence fragments) themselves,
    but we've said that sentences that had variables <!--Style me with CSS--><em>in them</em> were ambiguous
    and didn't even deserve to be called logical statements. The notion
    of <!--Style me with CSS--><em>quantification</em>
    allows us to use the power of variables within a
    sentence without introducing ambiguity.
