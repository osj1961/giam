    On August 16th 2003, Ma Lihua of Beijing, China earned her place in the
    record books by single-handedly setting up an arrangement of dominoes
    standing on end (actually, the setup took 7 weeks and was almost ruined by
    some cockroaches in the Singapore Expo Hall) and toppling them.
    After the first domino was tipped over it took about six minutes
    before 303,621 out of the 303,628 dominoes had fallen. (One has to wonder
    what kept those other 7 dominoes upright â€¦)
