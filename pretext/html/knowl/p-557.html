    The antecedent of the UCS is that \(a,b,c\) and \(d\) must be
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>consecutive</em>. By concentrating our attention on what it
    means to be consecutive, we should quickly realize that the original
    way we thought of the problem involved a red herring. We don't need
    to have variables for all four numbers; because they are consecutive,
    \(a\) uniquely determines the other three. Finally we have a version
    of the statement that we'd like to prove that should lend itself
    to our proof efforts.
