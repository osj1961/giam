    Note that in a flowchart the action of a “Goto” statement is clear
    because an arrow points to the location where program flow is being
    redirected. In pseudocode a “Label” statement is required which
    indicates a spot where flow can be redirected via subsequent “Goto”
    statements. Because of the potential for confusion in complicated
    algorithms that involve multitudes of Goto statements and their
    corresponding Labels, this sort of redirection is now deprecated in
    virtually all popular programming environments.
