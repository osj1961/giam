    If you allow yourself to use a <!--Style me with CSS--><em>ruler</em> — i.e. a straight-edge with
    marks on it (indeed you really only need two marks a unit distance apart)
    then angle trisection <!--Style me with CSS--><em>can</em> be done via what is known as a
    neusis construction.
    Nevertheless, because of the central place of Euclid's <!--Style me with CSS--><em>Elements</em> in
    mathematical training throughout the centuries, and thereby, a very
    strong predilection towards that which <!--Style me with CSS--><em>is</em> possible via compass and straight-edge
    alone, it is perhaps not surprising that a perfectly beautiful result that
    involved trisecting angles went undiscovered until 1899, when Frank Morley
    stated his Trisector Theorem. There is much more to this result than we will
    state here — so much more that the name “Morley's Miracle” that has been
    given to the Trisector theorem is truly justified — but even the simple,
    initial part of this beautiful theory is arguably miraculous! To learn more
    about Morley's theorem and its extension see  <a knowl="./knowl/lighthouse.html" knowl-id="xref-lighthouse" alt="Bibliographic Entry 8 " title="Bibliographic Entry 8 ">[8]</a>.
