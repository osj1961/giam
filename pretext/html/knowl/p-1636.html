    Now, every element of the disjoint union of \(A\) and \(B\) is in one of these
    sequences. Also, it is easy to see that these sequences are either disjoint
    or identical. Taking these two facts together it follows that these sequences
    form a partition of \(A \cup B\). We'll define a bijection
    \(\phi : A \longrightarrow B\) by deciding what it must do on these
    sequences. There are four possibilities for how the sequences we've
    just defined can play out. In extending them to the left, we may run
    into a place where one of the inverse functions needed isn't
    defined â€” or not. We say a sequence is an
    \(A\)-stopper, if, in extending to the left, we end
    up on an element of \(A\) that has
    no preimage under \(g\) (see <span>&lt;&lt;Unresolved xref, reference "fig_A-stopper"; check spelling or use "provisional" attribute&gt;&gt;</span>). Similarly,
    we can define a \(B\)-stopper.
    If the inverse functions are always defined within a given sequence there are
    also two possibilities; the sequence may be finite (and so it must be cyclic in
    nature) or the sequence may be truly infinite.
