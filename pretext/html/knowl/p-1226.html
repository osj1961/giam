    It would be pleasant if there were a nice way to refer to the preimage of
    some element, \(y\), of the range. One notation that you have probably
    seen before is “\(f^{-1}(y)\).” There is a major difficulty with writing
    down such a thing. By writing “\(f^{-1}\)” you are making a rather
    vast presumption — that there actually is a function that serves as an
    inverse for \(f\). Usually, there is not.
