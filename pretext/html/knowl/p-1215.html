    Sadly, only three of the sets we have just discussed are known to
    the mathematical world. The set we have denoted \(A'\) is called the
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>domain</em> of the function \(f\). The set we have denoted \(B'\) is
    known as the <!--Style me with CSS--><em>range</em> of the function \(f\). The set we have denoted
    \(B\) is called the <!--Style me with CSS--><em>codomain</em> of the function \(f\). The set we
    have been calling \(A\) does not have a name. In fact, the formal
    definition of the term “function” has been rigged so that there
    is no difference between the sets \(A\) and \(A'\). This seems a shame,
    if you think of range and domain as being primary, doesn't it seem
    odd that we have a way to refer to a superset of the range (i.e. the
    codomain) but no way of referring to a superset of the domain?
