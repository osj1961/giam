        A famous conjecture that is thought to be true (but
        for which no proof is known) is the  
        Twin Prime conjecture.
        A pair of primes is said to be twin if they differ by 2.
        For example, 11 and 13 are twin primes, as are 431 and 433.
        The Twin Prime conjecture states that there are an infinite
        number of such twins.  Try to come up with an argument as
        to why 3, 5 and 7 are the only prime triplets.



        \hint{It has to do with one of the numbers being divisible by 3. (Why is this forced to be the case?) If that number isn't actually 3, then you know it's composite.}
