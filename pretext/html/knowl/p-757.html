    We are about to see our first example of a categorical correspondence.
    Logic and Set theory are different aspects of the same thing. To
    describe a set people often quote
     Kurt Gödel — “A set is a Many that allows itself to be thought of as a One.” (Note

    concept ends up sounding rather mystical.) A more practical approach is
    to think of a set as the collection of things that make some open sentence
