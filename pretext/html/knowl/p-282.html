    Suppose the child finishes the peas and the mother comes across
    with the dessert. Clearly, in this situation the mother's statement
    was true. On the other hand, if the child finishes the hated peas
    and yet does not receive a treat, it is just as obvious that the
    mother has lied!
    What do we say about the mother's veracity in the case that the peas
    go unfinished? Here, Mom gets a break. She can either hold firm
    and deliver no dessert, or she can be a softy and give out unearned
    sweets â€” in either case, we can't accuse her of telling a falsehood.
    The statement she made had to do <!--Style me with CSS--><em>only</em> with the eventualities
    following total pea consumption, she said nothing about what happens
    if the peas go uneaten.
