    In this section we'll talk about another Book proof also due to John
    Conway. This proof serves as an introduction to a really powerful
    general technique â€” the idea of an invariant. An invariant is some
    sort of quantity that one can calculate that itself doesn't change as
    other things are changed. Of course different situations have different
    invariant quantities.
