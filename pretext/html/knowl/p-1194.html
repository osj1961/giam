    The previous paragraph gives a relatively precise definition of a graph
    in terms of sets, however the real way to think of graphs is in terms
    of diagrams where a set of dots are connected by paths. (The paths will,
    of course, need to
    have arrows on them in digraphs.) Below are a few examples of the
    diagrams that are used to represent graphs.
