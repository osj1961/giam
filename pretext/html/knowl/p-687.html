    Proof by cases is subtly different from exhaustive proof — for one
    thing a valid proof by cases can be used in an infinite universe.
    In a proof by cases one has to divide the universe of discourse into
    a finite number of sets<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-23" id="fn-23"><span class="footnote"><sup> 1 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-23" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">It is necessary to provide an argument that 
    this list of cases is complete!  I.e. that every element of the universe
    falls into one of the cases.</span></span> and then provide a separate proof for each
    of the cases. A great many statements about the integers can be proved
    using the division of integers into even and odd. Another set of
    cases that is used frequently is the finite number of possible remainders
    obtained when dividing by an integer \(d\). (Note that even and odd correspond
    to the remainders \(0\) and \(1\) obtained after division by \(2\).)
