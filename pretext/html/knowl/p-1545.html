    We have seen several interesting examples of equivalence relations
    already, and in this section we will explore one more: we'll say two sets are equivalent
    if they have the same number of elements. Usually, an equivalence relation
    has the effect that it highlights one characteristic of the objects being studied,
    while ignoring all the others. Equivalence of sets brings the issue of size (a.k.a.
    cardinality) into sharp focus while, at the same time, it forgets all about the
    many other features of sets. Sets that are equivalent (under the relation we
    are discussing) are sometimes said to be 
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>equinumerous</em>

    to indicate that sets are the same size. This term actually applies to 
    logical statements that are deducible from one another.</span></span>.
