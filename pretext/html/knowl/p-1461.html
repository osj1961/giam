    The “things” and the “containers” don't necessarily have to be
    interpreted in the strict sense that the “things” go <!--Style me with CSS--><em>into</em>
    the “containers.”
    For instance, a nice application of the pigeonhole principle is that
    if there are at least 13 people present in a room, some pair of people
    will have been born in the same month. In this example the things are the
    people and the containers are the months of the year.
