    Let us set aside, for the moment, further questions about Fermat numbers.
    Suppose we define the set \(U\) (for `Universe') by \(U=\{0,1,2,3,4\}\).
    Then the assertion, “\(\forall x \in U, P(x)\).” is certainly true.
    You should note that the only variable in this sentence is \(x\), and
    that the variable is bound — it is universally quantified. Open sentences
    that have all variables bound are <!--Style me with CSS--><em>statements</em>. It is possible
    (in principle, and in finite universes, in practice) to check the
    truth value of such sentences.
    Indeed, the sentence “\(\forall x \in U, P(x)\)” has the same logical content
    as “\(P(0) \land P(1) \land P(2) \land P(3)  \land P(4)\)”. Both happen to be
    true, but the real point here is to note that a universally quantified sentence
    can be thought of instead as a conjunction.
