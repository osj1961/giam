    If you are working on proving a UCS and the direct approach seems to be
    failing you may find that another indirect approach,
    proof by contraposition,
    will do the trick. In one sense this proof technique isn't really all that
    indirect; what one does is determine the contrapositive of the original
    conditional and then prove <!--Style me with CSS--><em>that</em> directly. In another sense this
    method <!--Style me with CSS--><em>is</em> indirect because a proof by contraposition can usually
    be recast as a proof by contradiction fairly easily.
