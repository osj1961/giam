    Which set is bigger — the natural numbers, \(\Naturals\) or the set,
    \(\Enoneg\), of nonnegative even numbers?
    Both are clearly infinite, so the “infinity is infinity” camp might be lead
    to the correct conclusion through invalid reasoning. On the other hand,
    the even numbers are contained in the natural numbers so there's a pretty
    compelling case for saying the evens are somehow smaller than the naturals.
    The mathematically rigorous way to show that these sets have the same
    cardinality is by displaying a one-to-one correspondence. Given an even
    number how can we produce a natural to pair it with? And, given a natural
    how can we produce an even number to pair with it?
    The map \(f : N \longrightarrow \Enoneg\) defined by \(f(x) = 2x\)
    is clearly a function,
    and just about as clearly, injective<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-55" id="fn-55"><span class="footnote"><sup> 1 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-55" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">If \(x\) and \(y\) are 
    different numbers that map to the same value, then f(x) = f(y) so
    2x = 2y. But we can cancel the 2's and derive that x = y, which is a contradiction.</span></span>. Is the map \(f\) also a surjection? In other
    words, is every non-negative even number the image of some natural under
    \(f\)? Given some non-negative even number \(e\) we need to be able to come
    up with an \(x\) such that \(f(x) = e\). Well, since \(e\) is an even number, by the
    definition of “even” we know that there is an integer \(k\) such that \(e = 2k\)
    and since \(e\) is either zero or positive it follows that \(k\) must also be
    either \(0\) or positive. It turns out that \(k\) is actually the \(x\) we
    are searching for. Put more
    succinctly, every non-negative even number \(2k\) has a preimage, \(k\), under the
    map \(f\). So \(f\) maps \(\Naturals\) surjectively onto \(\Enoneg\).
    Now the sets we've just considered,
    \begin{equation*}
      \Naturals \; = \; \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, \ldots \}
    \end{equation*}
    and
    \begin{equation*}
      \Enoneg \; = \; \{0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, \ldots \}
    \end{equation*}
    both have the feature that they can be listed — at
    least in principle. There is a first element, followed by a
    second element, followed by a third element,
    et cetera, in each set. The next set we'll look at, Z, can't be listed so easily.
    To list the integers we need to let the dot-dot-dots go both forward (towards
    positive infinity) and backwards (towards negative infinity),
    \begin{equation*}
      \Integers \; = \; \{ \ldots , -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots \}.
    \end{equation*}
