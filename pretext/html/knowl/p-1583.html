    When restricted to the appropriate sets (\(f\)'s domain
    is restricted to \(\Naturals \times \Naturals\)
    and \(f^{-1}\)'s domain is restricted to \(\Naturals\)),
    these functions are two-sided inverses
    for one another. That fact is sufficient to prove that \(f\)
    is bijective.
    So far we have shown that the sets \(\Enoneg\), \(\Naturals\), \(\Integers\) and
    \(\Naturals \times \Naturals\) all have
    the same cardinality — \(\aleph_0\). We plan to provide an argument that there
    actually are other infinite cardinals in the next section. Before leaving the
    present topic (examples of set equivalence) we'd like to present another nice
    technique for deriving the bijective correspondences we use to show that sets
    are equivalent — geometric constructions.
    Consider the set of points on the line segment \([0, 1]\).
    Now consider the set
    of points on the line segment \([0, 2]\). This second line
    segment, being twice as
    long as the first, must have a lot more points on it. Right?
