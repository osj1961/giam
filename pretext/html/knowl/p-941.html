    Rather than continuing to talk about subsets of the naturals, it will
    be convenient to recast our discussion in terms of infinite families
    of logical statements. If we have a sequence of statements, (one
    for each natural number) \(P_0\), \(P_1\), \(P_2\), \(P_3\), … we
    can prove them <!--Style me with CSS--><em>all</em> to be true using PMI. We have to do two
    things. First — and this is usually the easy part — we must show
    that \(P_0\) is true (i.e. the first domino <!--Style me with CSS--><em>will</em> get knocked over).
    Second, we must show, for every possible value of \(k\), \(P_k \implies P_{k+1}\)
    (i.e. each domino will knock down its successor). These two parts
    of an inductive proof are known, respectively, as the <!--Style me with CSS--><em>basis</em>
    and the <!--Style me with CSS--><em>inductive step</em>.
