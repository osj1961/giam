    The so-called “ethic of reciprocity” is an idea that has come 
    up in many of the world's religions and philosophies.  
    Below are statements of the ethic
    from several sources.  Discuss their logical meanings and determine which (if 
    any) are logically equivalent.

    \hint{
    The ones from Wicca and George Bernard Shaw are just there for laughs.

    For the remainder, you may want to contrast how restrictive they seem. For example the Christian version is (in my opinion) a lot stronger than the one from the Talmud —“treat others as you would want to be treated” restricts your actions both in terms of what you would like done to you and in terms of what you wouldn't like done to you; “Don't treat your fellows in a way that would be hateful to you.” is leaving you a lot more freedom of action, since it only prohibits you from doing those things you wouldn't want done to yourself to others. The Hindus, Epictetus and the Jews (and the Wiccans for that matter) seem to be expressing roughly the same sentiment — and promoting an ethic that is rather more easy for humans to conform to!

    From a logical perspective it might be nice to define open sentences:
    \begin{equation*}
      W(x,y) \; = \; \mbox{``x would want y done to him.''}
    \end{equation*}\begin{equation*}
      N(x,y)  \; = \; \mbox{``x would not want y done to him.''}
    \end{equation*}\begin{equation*}
      D(x,y)  \; = \; \mbox{``do y to x.''}
    \end{equation*}\begin{equation*}
      DD(x,y)  \; = \; \mbox{``don't do y to x.''}
    \end{equation*}
    In which case, the aphorism from Luke would be
    \begin{equation*}
      (W(you, y) \implies  D(others, y)) \land (N(you, y) \implies DD(others, y))
    \end{equation*}
