    Adding to the glossary or translation lexicon we started earlier,
    there are symbols which describe both these types of quantification.
    The symbol \(\forall\), an upside-down A, is used for universal
    quantification, and is usually translated as “for all.”
    The symbol \(\exists\), a backwards E, is used for existential
    quantification, it's translated as “there is” or “there exists.”
    Lets have a look at a mathematically precise sentence that captures
    the meaning of the one with which we started this section.
    \begin{equation*}
      \forall x \in \Integers, \; \exists y \in \Integers, \; x+y=0.
    \end{equation*}
