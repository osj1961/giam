    Let's proceed with our menagerie of sets of numbers. The next set
    we'll consider is \(\Reals\), the set of real numbers. To someone
    who has completed Calculus, the reals are perhaps the most obvious and
    natural notion of what is meant by “number.” It may be surprising to
    learn that the actual definition of what is meant by a real number is
    extremely difficult. In fact, the first reasonable formulation of a
    precise definition of the reals came around 1858, more than 180 years
    after the development of the
    Calculus<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-3" id="fn-3"><span class="footnote"><sup> 3 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-3" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">Although it was not
      published until 1736, Newton's book (De Methodis Serierum et
      Fluxionum) describing both differential and integral Calculus was
      written in 1671.</span></span>. A precise
    definition for the set \(\Reals\) of real numbers is
    beyond the scope of this book, for the moment consider the
    following intuitive description. A real number is a number that
    measures some physical quantity. For example, if a circle has
    diameter 1 then its circumference is \(\pi\), thus \(\pi\) is a real
    number. The points \((0,0)\) and \((1,1)\) in the Cartesian plane have
    distance \(\sqrt{ (0-1)^2 + (0-1)^2} = \sqrt{2}\), thus \(\sqrt{2}\) is
    a real number. Any rational number is clearly a real number — slope
    is a physical quantity, and the line from \((0,0)\) to \((b,a)\) has slope
    \(a/b\). In ancient Greece, Pythagoras — who has sometimes been
    described as the first pure Mathematician, believed that
    every real quantity was in fact rational, a belief that we now know to
    be false. The numbers \(\pi\) and \(\sqrt{2}\) mentioned above are not
    rational numbers. For the moment it is useful to recall a practical
    method for distinguishing between rational numbers and real quantities
    that are not rational — consider their decimal expansions. If the
    reader is unfamiliar with the result to which we are alluding, we urge
    you to experiment. Use a calculator or (even better) a computer
    algebra package to find the decimal expansions of various quantities.
    Try \(\pi\), \(\sqrt{2}\), \(1/7\), \(2/5\), \(16/17\), \(1/2\) and a few other
    quantities of your own choice. Given that we have already said that the first
    two of these are not rational, try to determine the pattern. What is
    it about the decimal expansions
    that distinguishes rational quantities from reals that aren't rational?
