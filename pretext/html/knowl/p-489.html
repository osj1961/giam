    Deduction 
    is the process by which we determine new truths from old.
    It is sometimes claimed that nothing truly new can come from deduction,
    the truth of a statement that is arrived at by deductive processes was
    lying (perhaps hidden somewhat) within the hypotheses. This claim is something
    of a canard, as any Sherlock Holmes aficionado can tell you, the statements
    that can sometimes be deduced from others can be remarkably surprising.
    A better
    argument against deduction is that it is a relatively ineffective way for most
    human beings to discover new truths â€” for that purpose inductive processes are
    superior for the majority of us. Nevertheless, if a chain of deductive reasoning
    leading from known hypotheses to a particular conclusion can be exhibited, the truth
    of the conclusion is <!--Style me with CSS--><em>unassailable</em>. For this reason, mathematicians have
    latched on to deductive reasoning as <!--Style me with CSS--><em>the</em> tool for, if not discovering
    our theorems, communicating them to others.
