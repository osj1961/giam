    In every branch of Mathematics there are special, 
    atomic, notions that
    defy precise definition. In Geometry, for example, the atomic notions
    are points, lines and their incidence. Euclid defines a point as
    “that which has no part” — people can argue (and have argued) incessantly
    over what exactly is meant by this. Is it essentially saying that anything
    without volume, area or length of some sort is a point? In modern times
    it has been recognized that any formal system of argumentation has to
    have such elemental, undefined, concepts — and that Euclid's apparent
    lapse in precision comes from an attempt to hide this basic fact.
    The notion of “point” can't really <!--Style me with CSS--><em>be</em> defined. All we can do
    is point (no joke intended) at a variety of points and hope that our
    audience will absorb the same concept of point that we hold via the
    process of induction<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-9" id="fn-9"><span class="footnote"><sup> 1 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-9" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">inference of a
