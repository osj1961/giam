    The proof of this surprising result works by using a fairly simple, but
    clever, strategy. We assign a numerical value to a set of men that is
    dependent on their positions — then we show that this value never increases
    when we make “checker jumping” moves — finally we note that the
    value assigned to a man in position \((0,5)\) is equal to the value of the
    entire original set of men (that is, with <!--Style me with CSS--><em>all</em> the positions in the lower
    half-plane occupied). This is a pretty nice strategy, but how exactly are
    we going to assign these numerical values?
