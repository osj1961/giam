    Now, mark the lines in which all of the premises of this argument form
    are true. You should note that <!--Style me with CSS--><em>in every single situation in which
    all the premises are true</em> the conclusion is also true. That's what
    makes “destructive dilemma” — and all of its friends — a rule of
    inference. Whenever all the premises are true so is the conclusion.
    You should also notice that there are several rows in which the
    conclusion is true but some one of the premises isn't. That's
    okay too, isn't it reasonable that the conclusion of an argument
    can be true, but at the same time the particulars of the argument
    are unconvincing?
