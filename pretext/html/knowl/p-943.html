    Soon we'll do an actual example of an inductive
    proof, but first we have to say something <!--Style me with CSS--><em>REALLY IMPORTANT</em>
    about such proofs. Pay attention! This is <!--Style me with CSS--><em>REALLY IMPORTANT</em>!
    When doing the second part of an inductive proof (the inductive step),
    you are proving a UCS, and if you recall how that's done, you start
    by assuming the antecedent is true. But the particular UCS we'll
    be dealing with is \(\forall k,  P_k \implies P_{k+1}\). That means
    that in the course of proving \(\forall n,  P_n\) we have to <!--Style me with CSS--><em>assume</em>
    that \(P_k\) is true. Now this sounds very much like the error known
    as “circular reasoning,” especially as many authors don't even
    use different letters (\(n\) versus \(k\) in our outline) to distinguish
    the two statements. (And, quite honestly, we only introduced the variable
    \(k\) to assuage a certain lingering guilt regarding circular reasoning.)
    The sentence \(\forall n,  P_n\) is what we're trying to prove, but the
    sentence we need to prove in order to do that is \(\forall k,  P_k \implies P_{k+1}\).
    This is subtly different — in proving that \(\forall k,  P_k \implies P_{k+1}\)
    (which is a UCS!) we assume that \(P_k\) is true <!--Style me with CSS--><em>for some particular value of \(k\)</em>.
