    Now that we have the special logical sentences represented by \(t\) and \(c\)
    we can present the so-called <!--Style me with CSS--><em>identity laws</em>,
    \(A \land t \cong A\) and
    \(A \lor c \cong A\). If you “and” a statement with something that is always
    true, this new compound has the exact same truth values as the original.
    If you “or” a statement with something that is always false, the new compound
    statement is also unchanged from the original. Thus performing a
    conjunction with a tautology has no effect — sort of like multiplying by 1.
    Performing a disjunction with a contradiction also has no effect — this is
    somewhat akin to adding 0.
