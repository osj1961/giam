    Transitivity is an extremely useful property as witnessed by the fact that both equivalence
    relations and ordering relations must have this property. When speaking of the transitive
    property of equality we say “Two things that are equal to a third, are equal to each other.”
    When dealing with ordering we may encounter statements like the following.
    “Since `Aardvark' precedes `Bulwark'
    in the dictionary, and since `Bulwark' precedes `Catastrophe', it is plainly true that `Aardvark'
    comes before `Catastrophe' in the dictionary.”
