    While this brief introduction to the means of notating algorithms is by no
    means complete, it is hopefully sufficient for our purpose which is
    solely to introduce two algorithms that are important in elementary
    number theory. The  division algorithm,
    as presented here, is simply
    an explicit version of the process one follows to calculate a quotient
    and remainder using long division. The procedure we give is unusually
    inefficient — with very little thought one could devise an algorithm
    that would produce the desired answer using many fewer operations — however the main point here is purely to show that division can be
    accomplished by essentially mechanical means. The Euclidean algorithm
    is far more interesting both from a theoretical and a practical
    perspective. The Euclidean algorithm computes the greatest common
    divisor (gcd) of two integers. The gcd of of two numbers \(a\) and \(b\)
    is denoted \(\gcd{a}{b}\) and is the largest integer that divides both
    \(a\) and \(b\) evenly.
