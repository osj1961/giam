    For example, in the exercises in <a href="sec_cases.html" alt="Section 3.5 Even more direct proofs: By cases and By exhaustion" title="Section 3.5 Even more direct proofs: By cases and By exhaustion">Section 3.5</a> we
    introduced vampire numbers. A  <!--Style me with CSS--><em>vampire number</em>
    is a
    \(2n\) digit number \(v\) that factors as \(v=xy\)
    where \(x\) and \(y\) are \(n\) digit numbers and the digits of \(v\) are the
    union of the digits in \(x\) and \(y\) in some order. The numbers \(x\) and \(y\)
    are known as the “fangs” of \(v\). To eliminate trivial
    cases, pairs of trailing zeros are disallowed.
