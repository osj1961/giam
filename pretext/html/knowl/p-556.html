    Generally, the first thing to do in proving a universal statement like
    this is to rephrase it as a conditional. The resulting statement is a
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>Universal Conditional Statement</em>
    or a UCS. The reason for taking
    this step is that the <!--Style me with CSS--><em>hypotheses</em> will then be clear â€” they form
    the antecedent of the UCS. So, while you won't have really made any
    progress in the proof by taking this advice, you will at least know what tools
    you have at hand. Taking the example we started with, and rephrasing
    it as a UCS we get
    \begin{equation*}
      \forall a,b,c,d \in \Integers, (\mbox{a,b,c,d  consecutive} ) 
      \implies \exists k \in \Integers, a{\cdot}b{\cdot}c{\cdot}d = k^2 -1
    \end{equation*}
