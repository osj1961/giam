    The sentence \(P_k\) is known as the
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>inductive hypothesis</em>.
    Think about it this way: If we were doing an entirely separate
    proof of \(\forall n,  P_n \implies P_{n+1}\), it would certainly be fair
    to use the inductive hypothesis, and <!--Style me with CSS--><em>once that proof was done</em>,
    it would be okay to quote that result in an inductive proof of
    \(\forall n,  P_n\). Thus we can compartmentalize our way out of the
    difficulty!
