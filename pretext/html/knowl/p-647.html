    The main problem in applying the method of proof by contradiction
    is that it usually involves “cleverness.” You have to come up
    with some reason why the presumption that the theorem is false leads
    to a contradiction — and this may or may not be obvious. More than
    any other proof technique, proof by contradiction demands that we use
    drafts and rewriting. After monkeying around enough that we find a
    way to reach a contradiction, we need to go back to the beginning
    of the proof and highlight the feature that we will eventually contradict!
    After all, we want it to look like our proofs are completely clear, concise
    and reasonable even if their formulation caused us some sort
    of Gordian-level mental anguish.
