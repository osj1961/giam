    In proving this statement we have little choice but to work backwards
    from the conclusion because the only hypothesis we have to work with
    is that \(a\) and \(b\) are non-negative real numbers â€” which isn't a
    particularly potent tool. But what should we do?
    There isn't a good response to that
    question, we'll just have to try a bunch of different things and hope
    that something will work out. When we finally get around to writing up
    our proof though, we'll have to rearrange the statements in the opposite
    order from the way they were discovered. This means that we would
    be ill-advised to make any uni-directional inferences, we should
    strive to make biconditional connections between our statements
    (or else try to intentionally make converse errors).
