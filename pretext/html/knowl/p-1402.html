    In (very) early computers and business machines, paper cards were used to
    store information. A so-called “punch card” or
     “Hollerith card” was used to store
    binary information by means of holes punched into it. Paper tape
    was also used in a similar fashion. A typical paper tape format would
    involve 8 positions in rows across the tape that might or might not be
    punched, often a column of smaller holes would appear as well which
    did not store information but were used to drive the tape through the
    reading mechanism on a sprocket. Tapes and cards could be “read” either
    by small sets of electrical contacts which would touch through a punched
    hole or be kept separate if the position wasn't punched, or by using a
    photo-detector to sense whether light could pass through the hole or not.
    The mechanisms for reading and writing on these paper media were amazingly
    accurate, and allowed early data processing machines to use just a couple
    of large file cabinets to store what now fits in a jump drive one can
    wear on a necklace. (About 10 or 12 cabinets could hold a gigabyte
    of data).
