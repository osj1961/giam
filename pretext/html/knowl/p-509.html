<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>
        In the movie “Monty Python and the Holy Grail” we encounter
        a medieval villager who (with a bit of prompting) makes the 
        following argument.
        <blockquote>
        If she weighs the same as a duck, then she's made of wood. 
        If she's made of wood then she's a witch. 
        Therefore, if she weighs the same as a duck, she's a witch.
        </blockquote>
        Which rule of inference is he using?

        \hint{
        This is what many people refer to as the transitive rule of implication.  As an argument form it's known as “hypothetical syllogism.”
        }
