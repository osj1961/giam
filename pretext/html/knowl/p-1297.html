    Whenever we have a subset/superset relationship, \(S \subseteq D\),
    it is possible to define a function whose codomain is \(\{0,1\}\)
    which performs a very useful task â€” if an input \(x\) is in the
    set \(S\) the function will indicate this by returning 1, otherwise
    it will return 0. The function which has this behavior is known
    as \(1_S\), and is called the 
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>characteristic function of the subset \(S\)</em> (There are those
    who use the term <!--Style me with CSS--><em>indicator function of \(S\)</em>
    for \(1_S\).) By definition,
    \(D\) is the domain of this function.
    \begin{align*}
1_S: D \longrightarrow \{0,1\}\\
1_S(x) = \left\{ \begin{array}{cl} 1 \amp  \mbox{if}  \, x \in S \\ 0 \amp  \mbox{otherwise} 
      \end{array}  \right.
\end{align*}
