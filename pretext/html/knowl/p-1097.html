    In the examples we've looked at the things on either side of a relation
    are of the same type. This is usually, but not always, the case. The
    prevalence of relations with the same kind of things being compared has
    even lead to the aphorism “Don't compare apples and oranges.” Think
    about the symbol \(\in\) for a moment. As we've seen previously, it
    isn't usually appropriate to put <!--Style me with CSS--><em>sets</em> on either side of this,
    we might have numbers or other objects on the left and sets on the right.
    Let's look at a small example. Let \(A = \{1,2,3,a,b\}\) and let
    \(B=\{ \{1,2,a\}, \{1,3,5,7,\ldots\}, \{1\} \}\). The “element of”
    relation, \(\in\), is a <!--Style me with CSS--><em>relation from \(A\) to \(B\)</em>.
