    Because a conditional sentence is equivalent to a certain disjunction, and 
    because DeMorgan's law tells us that the negation of a disjunction is a conjunction,
    it follows that the negation of a conditional is a conjunction.  Find denials (the negation
    of a sentence is often called its “denial”) for each of the following conditionals.
