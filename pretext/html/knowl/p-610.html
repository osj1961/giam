    There is a lovely result known as the
    
    “arithmetic-geometric mean inequality”
    whose proof epitomizes this approach. Basically this inequality compares two
    different ways of getting an “average” between two real numbers. The
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>arithmetic mean</em> of two real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) is the one you're
    probably used to, \((a+b)/2\). Many people just call this the “mean”
    of \(a\) and \(b\) without using the modifier “arithmetic” but as we'll
    see, our notion of what intermediate value to use in between two numbers
    is dependent on context. Consider the following two sequences of numbers
    (both of which have a missing entry)
    \begin{equation*}
      2  9   16   23   \rule{12pt}{.5pt}   37   44
    \end{equation*}
    and
    \begin{equation*}
      3  6   12   24   \rule{12pt}{.5pt}   96   192.
    \end{equation*}
