    In <a knowl="./knowl/tab_roi.html" knowl-id="xref-tab_roi" alt="Table 2.6.2 " title="Table 2.6.2 ">Table 2.6.2</a>, the ten most common
    rules of inference are listed.
    Note that all of these are equivalent to tautologies that
    involve conditionals (as opposed to biconditionals), every one of the
    basic logical equivalences that we established in <a href="sec_le.html" alt="Section 2.3 Logical equivalences" title="Section 2.3 Logical equivalences">Section 2.3</a>
    is really a tautology involving a biconditional, collectively these are
    known as the “rules of replacement.”
    In an argument, any statement
    allows us to infer a logically equivalent statement. Or, put differently,
    we could replace any premise with a different, but logically equivalent,
    premise. You might enjoy trying to determine a minimal set of rules of
    inference, that together with the rules of replacement would allow one
    to form all of the same arguments as the ten rules in <a knowl="./knowl/tab_roi.html" knowl-id="xref-tab_roi" alt="Table 2.6.2 " title="Table 2.6.2 ">Table 2.6.2</a>.
