      We'll proceed by contradiction. Suppose to the contrary that there is a
      triangle, \(\triangle ABC\), inscribed in a circle having maximum area that
      is not equilateral. Since \(\triangle ABC\) is not equilateral, there are
      two sides of it that are not equal. Without loss of generality, suppose that
      sides \(\overline{AB}\) and \(\overline{BC}\) have different lengths. Consider
      the remaining side (\(\overline{AC}\)) to be the base of this triangle.
      We can construct another triangle \(\triangle AB'C\), also inscribed in our circle, and also
      having \(\overline{AC}\) as its base, having a greater altitude than
      \(\triangle ABC\) â€” since the area of a triangle is given by
      the formula \(bh/2\) (where \(b\) is the base, and \(h\) is the altitude),
      this triangle's area is evidently greater than that of \(\triangle ABC\).
      This is a contradiction since \(\triangle ABC\) was presumed to have
      maximal area.
