    <span>&lt;&lt;Unresolved xref, reference "fig_CBS_setup"; check spelling or use "provisional" attribute&gt;&gt;</span> has a presumption in it —
    that \(A\) and \(B\) are countable — which
    need not be the case. Nevertheless, it gives us a good picture to work from.
    The basic hypotheses, that \(A\) and \(B\) are sets and we have two functions, one
    from \(A\) into \(B\) and another from \(B\) into A, are shown.
    We will have to build our bijective function in a piecewise manner.
    If there is a non-empty intersection between \(A\) and \(B\), we can use the
    identity function for that part of the domain of our bijection.
    So, without
    loss of generality, we can presume that \(A\) and \(B\) are disjoint.
    We can use
    the functions \(f\) and \(g\) to create infinite sequences, which
    alternate back and
    forth between \(A\) and \(B\), containing any particular element.
    Suppose \(a \in A\) is an arbitrary element. Since \(f\) is defined
    on all of \(A\), we
    can compute \(f(a)\). Now since \(f(a)\) is an element of \(B\), and \(g\) is
    defined on all
    of \(B\), we can compute \(g(f(a))\), and so on. Thus, we get the
    infinite sequence
    \begin{equation*}
      a,   f(a),  g(f(a)),  f(g(f(a))), \; \ldots
    \end{equation*}
