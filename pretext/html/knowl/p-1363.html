    Suppose that one wishes to come up with a password for a computer
    account. There are 52 letters (both upper and lower case) 10 numerals
    and 32 symbols and punctuation marks — for a total of 94 different
    characters that
    may be used. Some system administrators can be very paranoid about
    passwords that might be guessable — for instance no password that
    appears in a dictionary should ever be used on a system where security
    is a concern. Suppose that your system administrator will reject any
    password that has repeated symbols, and that passwords must have 8
    characters. How many passwords are possible?
