    You should think of a set as being an <!--Style me with CSS--><em>unordered</em> collection of
    things, thus \(\{ \mbox{popover} , 1, \mbox{froggy}  \}\) and
    \(\{ 1, \mbox{froggy} , \mbox{popover}  \}\) are two ways to represent the
    same set. Also, a set either contains, or doesn't contain, a given element.
    It doesn't make sense to have an element in a set multiple times. By
    convention, if an element is listed more than once when a set is
    listed we ignore the repetitions. So, the sets
    \(\{ 1, 1\}\) and \(\{1\}\) are really the same thing. If the notion
    of a set containing multiple instances of its elements is needed there
    is a concept known as a
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>multiset</em> that is studied in Combinatorics.
    In a multiset, each element is preceded by a so-called
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>repetition number</em>
    which may be the special symbol \(\infty\) (indicating an unlimited number
    of repetitions). The multiset concept is useful when studying puzzles like
    “How many ways can the letters of MISSISSIPPI be rearranged?” because the
    letters in MISSISSIPPI can be expressed as the multiset \(\{1\cdot M, 4\cdot I,
    2\cdot P, 4\cdot S \}\). With the exception of the following exercise, in the
    remainder of this chapter we will only be concerned with sets, never multisets.
