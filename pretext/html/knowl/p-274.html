<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>
          Consider the sentence 
          “This is a sentence which does not refer to itself.”
          which was given in the beginning of this chapter as an example.
          Is this sentence a statement?  If so, what is its truth value?

          \hint{The only question in your mind, when deciding whether a sentence is a statement, should be "Does this thing have a definite truth value?"
          Well?

          Isn't it just plainly false?}
