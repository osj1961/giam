  Here are a few pieces
  of advice about proofs by induction:

  <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li id="li-356"><p id="p-954">
        Statements that can be proved inductively don't always start out with 
        \(P_0\).  Sometimes \(P_1\) is the first statement in an infinite family.
        Sometimes its \(P_5\).  Don't get hung up about something that could be
        handled by renumbering things.
      </p></li>
<li id="li-357"><p id="p-955">
        In your final write-up you only need to prove the initial case
        (whatever it may be) for the basis, but it is a good idea to try 
        the first several cases while you are in the “draft” stage.  This
        can provide insights into how to prove the inductive step, and it may
        also help you avoid a classic error in which the inductive approach fails
        essentially just because there is a gap between two of the earlier 
        dominoes.<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-31" id="fn-31"><span class="footnote"><sup> 2 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-31" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">See <a knowl="./knowl/ex_horses.html" knowl-id="xref-ex_horses" alt="Item b " title="Item b ">exercise b</a>, the classic fallacious proof that all horses are the same color.</span></span>
      </p></li>
<li id="li-358"><p id="p-956">
        It is a good idea to write down somewhere just what it is that
        needs to be proved in the inductive step — just don't make it look like 
        you're assuming what needs to be shown.  For instance in the proof above
        it might have been nice to start the inductive step with a comment along
        the following lines, “What we need to show is that under the assumption
        that any set of size \(k\) has a power set of size \(2^k\), it follows that
        a set of size \(k+1\) will have a power set of size \(2^{k+1}\).”
      </p></li>
</ul>
