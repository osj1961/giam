    Naturally, we want to prove the Cantor-Bernstein-Schröder theorem (which
    we're going to start calling the C-B-S theorem for brevity), but first it'll be
    instructive to look at some of its consequences. Once we have the C-B-S
    theorem we get a very useful shortcut for proving set equivalences. Given
    sets \(A\) and \(B\), if we can find injective functions going between them in both
    directions, we'll know that they're equivalent. So, for example, we can use
    C-B-S to prove that the set of all infinite binary strings and the set of reals
    in (0, 1) really are equinumerous.
    (In case you had some remaining doubt… )
