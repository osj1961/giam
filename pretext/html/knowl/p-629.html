    Suppose we are trying to prove that all thrackles are polycyclic
    <span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-21" id="fn-21"><span class="footnote"><sup> 1 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-21" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">Both of these strange sounding words represent real 
    mathematical concepts, however, they don't have anything to do 
    with one another.</span></span>.
    A <!--Style me with CSS--><em>direct</em> proof of this would involve looking up the definition
    of what it means to be a thrackle, and of what it means to be polycyclic,
    and somehow discerning a way to convert whatever thrackle's logical equivalent
    is into the logical equivalent of polycyclic. As happens fairly often,
    there may be no obvious way to accomplish this task.
    Indirect proof takes
    a completely different tack. Suppose you had a thrackle that wasn't
    polycyclic, and furthermore, show that this supposition leads to something
    truly impossible. Well, if it's impossible for a thrackle to <!--Style me with CSS--><em>not</em> be
    polycyclic, then it must be the case that all of them <!--Style me with CSS--><em>are</em>.
    Such an argument is known as 
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>proof by contradiction</em>.
