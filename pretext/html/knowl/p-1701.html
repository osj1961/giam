    A man's value is related to his distance from the point \((0,5)\) in what
    is often called “the taxicab metric.” We don't use the straight-line
    distance, but rather determine the number of blocks we will have to drive
    in the north-south direction and in the east-west direction and add them
    together. The value of a set of men is the sum of their individual values.
    Since we need to deal with the value of the set of men that completely fills
    the lower half-plane, we are going to have to have most of these values be
    pretty tiny! To put it in a more mature and dignified manner: the infinite
    sum of the values of the men in our army must be convergent.
