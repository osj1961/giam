    Hopefully, you've seen
    Venn diagrams before, but possibly
    you haven't thought deeply about them. Venn diagrams take
    advantage of an obvious but important property of closed
    curves drawn in the plane. They divide the points in the
    plane into two sets, those that are inside the curve and
    those that are outside! (Forget for a moment about the points
    that are on the curve.) This seemingly obvious statement
    is known as the
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>Jordan curve theorem</em>, and actually
    requires some details. A
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>Jordan curve</em> is the sort
    of curve you might draw if you are required to end where
    you began and you are required not to cross-over any portion
    of the curve that has already been drawn. In technical
    terms such a curve is called <!--Style me with CSS--><em>continuous</em>, <!--Style me with CSS--><em>simple</em>
    and <!--Style me with CSS--><em>closed</em>.
    The Jordan curve theorem is one of those statements that hardly
    seems like it needs a proof, but nevertheless, the proof of this
    statement is probably the best-remembered work of the famous
    French mathematician Camille Jordan.
