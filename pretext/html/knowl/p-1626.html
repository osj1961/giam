    It is easy to see that this relation is reflexive and transitive. The Cantor-
    Bernstein-Schröder theorem proves that it is also anti-symmetric — which
    means dominance is an ordering relation. Be advised that there is an abuse
    of terminology here that one must be careful about — what are the domain
    and range of the “dominance” relation? The definition would lead us to
    think that sets are the things that go on either side of the “dominance”
    relation, but the notation is a bit more honest, “\(|A| &gt; |B|\)”
    indicates that the
    things really being compared are the cardinal numbers of sets (not the sets
    themselves). Thus anti-symmetry for this relation is
    \begin{equation*}
      (|A| &gt; |B|) \land (|B| &gt; |A|) \implies (|A| = |B|).
    \end{equation*}
