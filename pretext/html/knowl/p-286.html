    The problem is that “Finish your peas, or you won't
    get dessert.” has the same logical content as
    “If you get dessert then you finished your peas.”
    (Notice that the roles of the antecedent and consequent have been
    switched.) And, while this last sentence sounds awkward, it is
    probably a more accurate reflection of what the mother intended.
    The problem <!--Style me with CSS--><em>really</em> is that people are incredibly sloppy
    with their conditional statements! A lot of people secretly want
    the 3rd row of the truth table for \(\implies\) to have a \(\phi\)
    in it, and it simply doesn't! The operator that results if we do
    make this modification is called the 
    biconditional, and is expressed
    in English using the phrase “if and only if” (which leads mathematicians
    to the abbreviation “iff” much to the consternation of
    spell-checking programs everywhere). The biconditional is denoted
    using an arrow that points both ways. Its truth table follows.
