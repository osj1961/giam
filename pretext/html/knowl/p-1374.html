    You can describe a generic element of the above listing by saying “It starts
    with some number of 1's (which may be zero), then there are some 2's (again,
    it might be that there are zero 2's), then some (possibly none) 3's,
    then some 4's (or maybe not), then some
    5's (I think you probably get the idea) and finally some 6's (sorry for
    all the parenthetical remarks).”
