    So, instead of showing that the set of reals in \((0, 1)\) can't be put
    in one-to-one
    correspondence with \(\Naturals\), what we're really going to do is show
    that their binary expansions can't be put in one-to-one correspondence
    with \(\Naturals\). Since
    there are an infinite number of reals that have two different binary expansions
    this doesn't really do the job as advertised at the beginning of this section.
    (Perhaps you are getting used to our wily ways by now — yes, this does
    mean that we're going to ask you to do the real proof in the exercises.)
    The set of binary numerals, \(\{0, 1\}\), is an instance of a mathematical
    structure known as a field; basically, that means that it's possible to
    add, subtract, multiply and divide (but not divide by 0) with them.
    We are only mentioning this fact so that you'll understand why the set
    \(\{0, 1\}\) is often referred to as \({\mathbb F}_2\). We're only mentioning that
    fact so that you'll understand why we call the set of all possible
    binary expansion \({\mathbb F}_2^\infty\) . Finally, we're only mentioning <!--Style me with CSS--><em>that</em>
    fact so that we'll have a succinct way of expressing this set.
    Now we can write “\({\mathbb F}_2^\infty\)” rather than
    “the set of all possible infinitely-long binary sequences.”
