    In the game Yahtzee, one rolls 5 dice and (optionally) performs a
    second roll of some or all of the dice. The object is to achieve
    several final configurations that are modeled after the hands in
    Poker. In particular, one configuration, known as a “full house,”
    is achieved by having two of one number and three of another.
    (Colloquially, we say “three-of-a-kind plus a pair is a full house.”)
