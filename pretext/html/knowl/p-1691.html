    Think of these checkers as an army and the upper half-plane is “enemy
    territory.” Our goal is to move one of our soldiers into enemy territory
    as far as possible. The problem is that our “soldiers” move the
    way checkers do, by jumping over another man (who is then removed from
    the board). It's clear that we can get someone into enemy territory — just take someone in the second row and jump a guy in the first row.
    It is also easy enough to see that it is possible to get a man
    two steps into enemy territory — we could bring two adjacent men
    a single step into enemy territory, have one of them jump the other
    and then a man from the front rank can jump over him.
