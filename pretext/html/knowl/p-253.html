    Ambiguity is only one reason that a sentence may not be a statement. As
    we consider more complex sentences, it may be the case that the truth
    value of a given sentence simply cannot be decided. One of the most
    celebrated mathematical results of the 20th century is
    Kurt Gödel's
    “Incompleteness Theorem.”
    An important aspect of this theory is
    the proof that in any axiomatic system of mathematical thought
    there must be undecidable sentences — statements which can neither be proved
    nor disproved from the axioms<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-11" id="fn-11"><span class="footnote"><sup> 3 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-11" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">There are trivial systems that 
    are complete, but if a system is sufficiently complicated that it contains 
    “interesting” statements it can't be complete.</span></span>.
    Simple sentences (e.g. those of the form
    subject-verb-object) have little chance of being undecidable for this
    reason, so we will next look at ways of building more complex sentences
    from simple components.
