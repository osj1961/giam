      For certain problems it is natural to use some particular notational system.
      For example, the
      last theorem would tend to indicate that binary numbers are useful
      in problems dealing with even and odd. Given that there are many different
      notations that are available to us, it is obviously desirable to have
      means at our disposal for converting between them. It is possible to
      develop general rules for converting a base-\(a\) number to a base-\(b\)
      number (where \(a\) and \(b\) are arbitrary) but it is actually more convenient
      to pick a “standard” base (and since we're human we'll use base-\(10\))
      and develop methods for converting between an arbitrary base and the
      “standard” one. Imagine that in the not-too-distant future we need to
      convert some numbers from the base-\(7\) system used by the Seven-lobed
      Amoebazoids from Epsilon Eridani III to the base-\(12\) scheme favored
      by the Dodecatons of Alpha-Centauri IV. We will need a procedure
      for converting base-\(7\) to base-\(10\) and another procedure for converting
      from base-\(10\) to base-\(12\). In the School House Rock episode
      “Little Twelve Toes” they describe base-\(12\)
      numeration in a way that is understandable for elementary school
      children — the digits they use are
      \(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, \delta, \epsilon \}\), the last two digits
      (which are pronounced “dec” and “el”) are necessary since we need
      single symbols for the things we ordinarily denote using \(10\) and \(11\).
