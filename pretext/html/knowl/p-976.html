    To the beginning calculus student, the beauty of the above relationships may
    be somewhat dimmed by the memorization challenge that they represent. It
    is fortunate then, that the right-hand side of the third formula is just
    the square of the right-hand side of the first formula. And of course,
    the right-hand side of the first formula is something that can be deduced
    by a six year old child (provided that he is a super-genius!) This happy
    coincidence leaves us to apply most of our rote memorization energy to
    formula number two, because the first and third formulas are related by
    the following rather bizarre-looking equation,
    \begin{equation*}
      \sum_{j=1}^n j^3 = \left( \sum_{j=1}^n j \right)^2.
    \end{equation*}
