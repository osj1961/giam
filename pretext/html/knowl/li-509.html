          “Escape of the clones” is a  nice puzzle, originally proposed by Maxim Kontsevich.  The game
          is played on an infinite checkerboard restricted to the first quadrant — that is the squares may be 
          identified with points having integer coordinates \((x,y)\) with \(x&gt;0\) and \(y&gt;0\).  The “clones” are markers
          (checkers, coins, small rocks, whatever…) that can move in only one fashion — if the squares immediately
          above and to the right of a clone are empty, then it can make a “clone move.”   The clone moves one space
          up and a copy is placed in the cell one to the right.  We begin with three clones occupying cells \((1,1), (2,1)\) and \((1,2)\) — we'll refer to those three checkerboard squares as “the prison.”  The question is this:  can these
          three clones escape the prison?

          You must either demonstrate a sequence of moves that frees all three clones or provide an argument that the task is impossible.
