          Prove (by contradiction) that the sum of a rational and an irrational 
          number is irrational.

          \hint{Suppose that x is rational and y is irrational and their sum (let's call it z) is also rational. Do some algebra to solve for y, and you will see that y (which is, by presumption, irrational) is also the difference of two rational numbers (and hence, rational â€” a contradiction.)
          }
