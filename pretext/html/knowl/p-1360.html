    Selecting a PIN number<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-45" id="fn-45"><span class="footnote"><sup> 3 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-45" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">The phrase “PIN number” is 
    redundant.  The `N' in PIN stands for “number.”  Anyway, a PIN is
    a four digit (secret) number used to help ensure that automated banking
    (such as withdrawing your life's savings) is only done by an authorized
    individual.</span></span> for your bank account is a good example of
    the kind of problem that is dealt with in the lower left part of the
    table. Obviously, the order in which you key-in the digits of your PIN
    is important. If one's number is 1356, it won't do to put in 6531!
    Also there is no reason that we couldn't have repeated digits in a PIN.
    (Although someone who chooses a PIN like 3333 is taking a bit of a security
    risk! A bad guy looking over your shoulder may easily discern what your
    PIN is.) A PIN is an ordered selection of 4 things out of 10, where
    repetition is allowed. There are \(10^4\) possible PINs. We can determine
    this by thinking of the multiplication principle — there are 10 choices
    for the first digit of our PIN, since repetition is okay there are still
    10 choices for our second digit, then (still) 10 choices for the third
    digit as well as the fourth digit.
