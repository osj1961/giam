    There are two special classes of relations that we will study
    in the next two sections, equivalence relations and ordering relations.
    The prototype for an equivalence relation is the ordinary notion
    of numerical equality, \(=\). The prototypical ordering relation
    is \(\leq\). Each of these has certain salient properties that are the
    root causes of their importance. In this section we will study a
    compendium of properties that a relation may or may not have.
