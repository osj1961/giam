    Since conditional sentences are often confused with the sentence
    that has the roles of antecedent and consequent reversed, this
    switched-around sentence has been given a name: it is the
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>converse</em>
    of the original statement. Another conditional that is distinct from
    (but related to) a given conditional is its <!--Style me with CSS--><em>inverse</em>.
    This sort of sentence probably had to be named because of a very common
    misconception, many people think that the way to negate an if-then
    proposition is to negate
    its parts. Algebraically, this looks reasonable — sort of a distributive
    law for logical negation over implications — \({\lnot}( A \implies B) =
    {\lnot}A \implies {\lnot}B\). Sadly, this reasonable looking assertion
    can't possibly be true; since implications have just one \(\phi\) in a truth
    table, the negation of an implication must have three — but the statement
    with the \(\lnot\)'s on the <!--Style me with CSS--><em>parts</em> of the implication is going to only have
    a single \(\phi\) in <!--Style me with CSS--><em>its</em> truth table.
