    Well, one pretty serious objection to doing that is that the
    equals sign (\(=\)) has already got a job; it is used to indicate that
    two numerical quantities are the same. What we're doing here is
    really sort of a different thing! Nevertheless, there is a concept
    of “sameness” between certain compound statements, and we need a
    symbolic way of expressing it. There are two notations in common
    use. The notation that seems to be preferred by logicians is the
    biconditional (\(\iff\)). The notation we'll use
    in the rest of this book is an equals sign with a bit of extra decoration
    on it (\(\cong\)).
