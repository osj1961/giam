<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>
        Statements that can be proved inductively don't always start out with 
        \(P_0\).  Sometimes \(P_1\) is the first statement in an infinite family.
        Sometimes its \(P_5\).  Don't get hung up about something that could be
        handled by renumbering things.
