    What kinds of things are we counting in the lower right part of the table?
    Unordered selections of \(k\) things out of \(n\) possibilities where there may
    (or may not!) be repetitions. The game Yahtzee provides a nice example of
    this type of configuration. When we roll 5 dice, we do not do so
    one-at-a-time, rather, we roll them as a group — the dice are
    indistinguishable so there is no way to order our set of 5 outcomes.
    In fact, it would be quite reasonable to, after one's roll, arrange the
    die in (say) increasing order. We'll repeat a bit of advice that was given
    previously: if one is free to rearrange a configuration to suit one's needs,
    that is a clue that order is <!--Style me with CSS--><em>not</em> important in the configurations
    under consideration. Finally, are repetitions allowed? The outcomes
    in Yahtzee are 5 numbers from the set \(\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}\), and while it
    is possible to have no repetitions, that is a pretty special outcome!
    In general, the same number can appear on two, or several, or even
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>all 5</em> of the die<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-46" id="fn-46"><span class="footnote"><sup> 4 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-46" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">When this happens you are supposed
