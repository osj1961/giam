    To go the other direction — that is, to take a position
    in the listing and
    derive an ordered pair — we need to figure out where a given number lies
    relative to the triangular numbers. For instance, try to figure out what
    \((x, y)\) pair position number \(13\) will correspond with. Well, the next smaller
    triangular number is \(10\) which is \(T(4)\), so \(13\) will be the number of an
    ordered pair along the descending line whose \(y\)-intercept is \(4\).
    In fact, \(13\) will be paired
    with an ordered pair having a \(3\) in the \(x\)-coordinate (since \(13\) is \(3\)
    larger than \(10\)) so it follows that \(f^{-1}(13) = (3, 1)\).
