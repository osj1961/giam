          If a number \(x\) is even, it's easy to show that its square \(x^2\)
          is even.  The lemma that went unproved in this section asks us to
          start with a square (\(x^2\)) that is even and deduce that the UN-squared
          number (\(x\)) is even.  Perform some numerical experimentation to
          check whether this assertion is reasonable.  Can you give an argument
          that would prove it?



          \hint{What if the lemma wasn't true? Can you work out what it would mean if we had a number x such that x2 was even but x itself was odd?}
