          Provide a counterexample to dispel the notion that a subset must
          have fewer elements than its superset.

          \hint{A subset is called <!--Style me with CSS--><em>proper</em> if it is neither empty nor equal to the superset.   If
          we are talking about finite sets then the proper subsets do indeed have fewer elements
          than the supersets.  Among infinite sets it is possible to have proper subsets having the same 
          number of elements as their superset, for example there are just as many even natural numbers
          as there are natural numbers all told.}
