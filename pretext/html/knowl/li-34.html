        Another famous conjecture, also thought to be true â€” but
        as yet unproved, is 
        Goldbach's conjecture.  Goldbach's conjecture
        states that every even number greater than 4 is the sum of two odd
        primes.  There is a function \(g(n)\), known as the Goldbach function, defined
        on the positive integers, that gives the number of different ways to 
        write a given number as the sum of two odd primes.  For example \(g(10) = 2\)
        since \(10=5+5=7+3\).  Thus another version of Goldbach's conjecture
        is that \(g(n)\) is positive whenever \(n\) is an even number greater than
        4.

        Graph \(g(n)\) for \(6 \leq n \leq 20\).



        \hint{If you don't like making graphs, a table of the values of g(n) would suffice. Note that we don't count sums twice that only differ by order. For example, 16 = 13+3 and 11+5 (and 5+11 and 3+13) but g(16)=2.}
