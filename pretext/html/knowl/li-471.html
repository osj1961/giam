          A mathematician, who always rises earlier than her spouse, has
          developed a scheme — using the pigeonhole principle — to ensure that
          she always has a matching pair of socks.  She keeps only blue socks, green 
          socks and
          black socks in her sock drawer — 10 of each.  So as not to wake her 
          husband she must
          select some number of socks from her drawer in the early morning dark
          and take them with her to the adjacent bathroom where she dresses.
          What number of socks does she choose?
