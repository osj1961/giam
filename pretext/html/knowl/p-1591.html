    In the exercises from <a href="sec_equiv_sets.html" alt="Section 8.1 Equivalent sets" title="Section 8.1 Equivalent sets">Section 8.1</a> you were supposed
    to show that set
    equivalence is an equivalence relation. Part of that proof should have been
    showing that the relation is transitive, and that really just comes down to
    showing that the composition of two bijections is itself a bijection. If you
    didn't make it through that exercise give it another try now, but whether
    or not you can finish that proof it should be evident what that transitivity
    means to us in the current situation. Any pair of line segments are the same
    size — a line segment (i.e. an interval) and a semi-circle are the same size — the semi-circle and an infinite line are the same size — transitivity tells us that
    an infinitely extended line has the same number of points as (for example)
    the interval \((0, 1)\).
