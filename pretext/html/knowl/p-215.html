    Before we can actually give the proof we should prove an intermediary
    result — but we won't, we'll save this proof for the student to do
    later (heh, heh, heh…).
    These sorts of intermediate results, things that don't deserve to be
    called theorems themselves, but that aren't entirely self-evident are
    known as  lemmas. It is often the case that in an
    attempt at proving a statement we find ourselves in need of some small
    fact. Perhaps it even seems to be true but it's not clear. In such
    circumstances, good form dictates that we first state and prove the
    lemma then proceed on to our theorem and its proof. So, here, without
    its proof is the lemma we'll need.
