    The familiar \(x\)â€“\(y\) plane, is often called the Cartesian plane. This
    is done for two reasons. Rene Descartes, the famous
    mathematician and philosopher, was the first to consider coordinatizing
    the plane and thus is responsible for our current understanding of the
    relationship between geometry and algebra. Rene Descartes' name is also
    memorialized in the definition of the Cartesian product of sets, and the
    plane is nothing more than the product \(\Reals \times \Reals\). Indeed,
    the plane provided the very first example of the concept that was later
    generalized to the Cartesian product of sets.
