      The reason that a gambler might be interested in the number we just calculated
      is that binomial coefficients do more than just give us the coefficients in the
      expansion of a binomial. They also can be used to compute how many ways one
      can choose a subset of a given size from a set. Thus \(\binom{52}{5}\) is the
      number of ways that one can get a 5 card hand out of a deck of 52 cards.
