    This last example that we have done (the winding map) was unusual in that
    the outputs were ordered pairs. In thinking of this map as a relation
    (that is, as a set of ordered pairs) we have an ordered pair in which
    the second element is an ordered pair! Just for fun, here is another
    way of expressing the winding map:
    \begin{equation*}
      W = \{ (t, (\cos{t}, \sin{t})) \suchthat \, t \in \Reals \}
    \end{equation*}
