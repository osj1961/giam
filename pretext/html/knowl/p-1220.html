    Since we are now thinking of functions as special classes of relations, it follows that a function is just
    a set of ordered pairs. This means that the identity of a function is
    tied up, not just with a formula that gives the output for a given input,
    but also with what values can be used for those inputs. Thus the function
    \(f(x)=2x\) defined on \(\Reals\) is a completely different animal from
    the function \(f(x)=2x\) defined on \(\Naturals\). If you really want to
    specify a function precisely you must give its domain as well as a
    formula for it. Usually, one does this by writing a formula, then a
    semicolon, then the domain. (E.g. \(f(x)=x^2;  x \geq 0\).)
