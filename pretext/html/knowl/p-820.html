    Every rule that we learned in <a href="ch_logic.html" alt="Chapter 2 Logic and quantifiers" title="Chapter 2 Logic and quantifiers">Chapter 2</a>
    (see <a knowl="./knowl/tab_bool_equiv.html" knowl-id="xref-tab_bool_equiv" alt="Table 2.3.4 " title="Table 2.3.4 ">Table 2.3.4</a>) has a set-theoretic equivalent.
    These set-theoretic versions are
    expressed using equalities (i.e. the symbol \(=\) in between two sets) which
    is actually a little bit funny if you think about it. We normally
    use \(=\) to mean that two numbers or variables have the same numerical
    magnitude, as in \(12^2 = 144\), we are doing something altogether
    different when we use that symbol between two sets, as in \(\{1,2,3\}=
    \{\sqrt{1},\sqrt{4},\sqrt{9}\}\), but people seem to be used to this
    so there's no sense in quibbling.
