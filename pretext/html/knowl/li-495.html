          It is possible to generalize the argument that shows a line segment is
          equivalent to a line to higher dimensions.   In two dimensions we would
          show that the unit disk (the interior of the unit circle) is equinumerous
          with the entire plane \(\Reals \times \Reals\).   In three dimensions we would show that
          the unit ball (the interior of the unit sphere) is equinumerous with the
          entire space \(\Reals^3 = \Reals \times \Reals \times \Reals\).  Here we 
          would like you to prove the two-dimensional case.

          Gnomonic projection is a style of map rendering in which a portion of a
          sphere is projected onto a plane that is tangent to the sphere.  The 
          sphere's center is used as the point to project from.  Combine 
          vertical projection from the unit disk
          in the xâ€“y plane to the upper half of the unit sphere \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1\),
          with gnomonic projection from the unit sphere to the plane z = 1, to
          deduce a bijection between the unit disk and the (infinite) plane.
