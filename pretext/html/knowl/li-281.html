          A <!--Style me with CSS--><em>vampire number</em> is a \(2n\) digit number \(v\) that factors as \(v=xy\)
          where \(x\) and \(y\) are \(n\) digit numbers and the digits of \(v\) are the 
          union of the digits in \(x\) and \(y\) in some order.  The numbers \(x\) and \(y\)
          are known as the “fangs” of \(v\).  To eliminate trivial
          cases, pairs of trailing zeros are disallowed.  

          Show that there are no 2-digit vampire numbers.

          Show that there are seven 4-digit vampire numbers.

          \hint{The 2-digit challenge is do-able by hand (just barely).  The \(4\) digit question certainly requires 
          some computer assistance!}
