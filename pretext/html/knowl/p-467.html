        There is a common variant of the existential quantifier,
        \(\exists !\), if you write \(\exists ! \, x, \, P(x)\) you are asserting 
        that there is a <!--Style me with CSS--><em>unique</em> element 
        in the universe that makes \(P(x)\) true.
        Determine how to negate the sentence \(\exists ! \, x, \, P(x)\).



        \hint{
        Unique existence is essentially saying that there is exactly 1 element of the universe of discourse that makes P(x) true. The negation of "there is exactly 1" is "there's either none, or at least 2".

        Is that enough of a hint?
