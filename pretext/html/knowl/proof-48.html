      Consider the collection of all subsets of size \(k\) taken from
      \(N = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, n\}\) in which one of the elements has
      been marked to distinguish it from the others in some way.<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-51" id="fn-51"><span class="footnote"><sup> 1 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-51" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">
      For example, a committee of \(k\) individuals one of whom has been 
      chosen as chairperson, is an example of the kind of entity we are 
      discussing.</span></span>
    </p>
<p>
      We can count this collection in two ways using the multiplication rule.
    </p>
<p>
      Firstly, we could select a \(k\)-subset in \(\binom{n}{k}\) ways and then from
      among the \(k\) elements of the subset we could select one to be marked.
      By this analysis there are \(\binom{n}{k} \cdot k\) elements in our
      collection.
    </p>
<p>
      Secondly, we could select an element from the \(n\)-set which will be
      the “marked” element of our subset, and then choose the additional
      \(k-1\) elements from the remaining \(n-1\) elements of the \(n\)-set.
      By this analysis there are \(n \cdot \binom{n-1}{k-1}\) elements in
      the collection we have been discussing.
    </p>
<p>
      Thus,
      \begin{equation*}
        k \cdot \binom{n}{k} = n \cdot \binom{n-1}{k-1}
      \end{equation*}
