          Prove that if \(x^3-x^2\) is negative then \(3x+4 \lt  7\).

          \hint{This follows very easily by the method of working backwards from the conclusion. Remember that when multiplying or dividing both sides of an inequality by some number, the direction of the inequality may reverse (unless we know the number involved is positive).  Also, remember that we can't divide by zero, so if we are (just for example, don't know why I'm mentioning it reallyâ€¦) dividing both sides of an inequality by \(x^2\) then we must treat the case where \(x=0\) separately.}
