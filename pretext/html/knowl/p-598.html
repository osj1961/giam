            Suppose that \(x\) is an odd number and \(y\) is an even number. Since \(x\) is odd there is an
            integer \(k\) such that \(x=2k+1\). Furthermore, since \(y\) is even, there is an integer \(m\) such that
            \(y=2m\). By substitution, we can express the sum \(x+y\) as \(x+y = (2k+1) + (2m) = 2(k+m) + 1\).
            Since \(k+m\) is an integer (the sum of integers is an integer) it follows that \(x+y\) is odd.
