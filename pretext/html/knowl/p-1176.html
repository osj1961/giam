    What we've been discussing here is one of the first examples of a 
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>quotient structure</em>.
    We start with the integers and “mod out” by an equivalence relation. In doing so, we
    “move to the quotient” which means (in this instance) that we go from \(\Integers\) to a much simpler set
    having only five elements: \(\{ \overline{0}, \overline{1}, \overline{2}, \overline{3}, 
    \overline{4} \}\). In moving to the quotient we will generally lose a lot of information,
    but greatly highlight some particular feature — in this example, properties related to
    divisibility by 5.
