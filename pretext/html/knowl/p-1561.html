    The finite cardinalities are the equivalence classes (under the relation of
    set equivalence) containing the empty set and the sets \(\Naturals_k\).
    Of course there
    are also infinite sets! The prototype for an infinite set would have to be
    the entire set \(\Naturals\).
    The long-standing tradition is to use the
    symbol 
    \(\aleph_0\)<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-54" id="fn-54"><span class="footnote"><sup> 3 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-54" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">The Hebrew letter (capital) aleph with a 
    subscript zero — usually pronounced “aleph naught.”</span></span>
    for the cardinality
    of sets having the same size as \(\Naturals\), alternatively, such sets
    are known as “countable.” One could make a pretty good argument that
    it is the finite sets that are actually countable! After all it would literally take forever to count the natural numbers! We have to presume that the
    people who instituted
    this terminology meant for “countable” to mean “countable, in principle”
    or “countable if you're willing to let me keep counting forever” or maybe
    “countable if you can keep counting faster and faster and are capable of
    ignoring the speed of light limitations on how fast your lips can move.” Worse
    yet, the term “countable” has come to be used for sets whose cardinalities are
    either finite <!--Style me with CSS--><em>or</em> the size of the naturals. If we want to refer specifically to the infinite sort of countable set most mathematicians
    use the term <!--Style me with CSS--><em>denumerable</em> (although this is not universal) or  <!--Style me with CSS--><em>countably infinite</em>.
    Finally, there are sets
    whose cardinalities are bigger than the naturals. In other words, there are
    sets such that no one-to-one correspondence with \(\Naturals\) is possible.
    We don't mean that people have looked for one-to-one correspondences
    between such sets and \(\Naturals\) and haven't been able to find them — we literally mean that it can't be done; and it is has been proved that it can't be done! Sets having cardinalities that are this ridiculously huge are known as  <!--Style me with CSS--><em>uncountable</em>.
