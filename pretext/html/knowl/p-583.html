  As we've seen in the examples presented in this section, coming up
  with a proof can sometimes involve a bit of ingenuity. But, sometimes,
  there is a “follow your nose” sort of approach that will
  allow you to devise a valid argument without necessarily displaying
  any great leaps of genius! Here are a few pieces
  of advice about proof-writing:

  <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li id="li-223"><p id="p-584">
        Before anything else, determine precisely what hypotheses you
        can use.
      </p></li>
<li id="li-224"><p id="p-585">
        Jot down the definitions of <!--Style me with CSS--><em>anything</em> in the statement of 
        the theorem.
      </p></li>
<li id="li-225"><p id="p-586">
        There are 26 letters at your disposal (and even more if you know
        Greek) (and you can always throw on subscripts!) don't be stingy with
        letters.  The nastiest mistake you can make is to use the same variable
        for two different things.
      </p></li>
<li id="li-226"><p id="p-587">
        Please write a rough draft first.  Write two drafts!  Even if you
        can write beautiful, lucid prose on the first go around, it won't fly
        when it comes to organizing a proof.
      </p></li>
<li id="li-227"><p id="p-588">
        The statements in a proof are supposed to be logical statements.
        That means they should be Boolean (statements that are either true or false).
        An algebraic expression all by itself doesn't count, an inequality or an 
        equality does.
      </p></li>
<li id="li-228"><p id="p-589">
        Don't say “if” when you mean “since.”  Really!  If you start a
        proof about rational numbers like so:
        <blockquote>
<!--Style me with CSS--><em>Proof:</em> Suppose that \(x\) is a particular but arbitrary rational number.
        If \(x\) is a rational number, it follows that \ldots
        </blockquote>
        people are going to look at you funny.  What's the point of 
        <!--Style me with CSS--><em>supposing</em>
        that \(x\) is rational, then acting as if you're in doubt of that fact by
        writing “if”?   You mean “since.”
      </p></li>
<li id="li-229"><p id="p-590">
        Mark off the beginning and the end of your proofs as a hint to your
        readers.  In this book we start off a proof by writing <!--Style me with CSS--><em>Proof:</em> in 
        italics and we end every proof with the abbreviation 
        
        Q.E.D.<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-19" id="fn-19"><span class="footnote"><sup> 1 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-19" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote"><!--Style me with CSS--><em>Quod erat demonstrandum</em> or “(that) which was to 
        be demonstrated.” some authors prefer placing a small rectangle at 
        the end of their proofs, but Q.E.D. seems more pompous.</span></span>
