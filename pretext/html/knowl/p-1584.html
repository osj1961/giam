    Well, perhaps you're getting used to this sort of thingâ€¦
    The interval \([0, 1]\) is a subset of the interval \([0, 2]\),
    but since both represent infinite sets of points
    it's possible they actually have the same cardinality.
    We can prove that this is so using a geometric technique.
    We position the line segments appropriately
    and then use projection from a carefully chosen point to
    develop a bijection. Imagine both intervals as lying on
    the \(x\)-axis in the \(x\)-\(y\) plane. Shift the
    smaller interval up one unit so that it lies on the line
    \(y = 1\). Now, use projection
    from the point \((0, 2)\), to visualize the correspondence
