      Suppose to the contrary that \(f\) is a function with
      \(|\Dom{f}| &gt; |\Rng{f}|\) and that \(f\) is injective. Of course
      \(f\) is onto its range, so since we are presuming that \(f\) is injective
      it follows that \(f\) is a bijection between \(\Dom{f}\) and \(\Rng{f}\). Therefore (since \(f\) provides a one-to-one
      correspondence) \(|\Dom{f}| = |\Rng{f}|\). This clearly contradicts the
      statement that \(|\Dom{f}| &gt; |\Rng{f}|\).
