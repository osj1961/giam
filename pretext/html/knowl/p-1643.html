    The word “continuum” in the title of this section is used to indicate sets of
    points that have a certain continuity property. For example, in a real interval
    it is possible to move from one point to another, in a smooth fashion, without
    ever leaving the interval. In a range of rational numbers this is not possible,
    because there are irrational values in between every pair of rationals. There
    are many sets that behave as a continuum — the intervals (a, b) or [a, b], the
    entire real line \(\Reals\), the x-y plane \(\Reals \times \Reals\), a volume in 3-dimensional space (or
    for that matter the entire space \(\Reals^3\)). It turns out that all of these sets have
    the same size.
