    A very famous instance of proof by cases is the computer-assisted proof
    of the
    
    four color theorem. The four color theorem is a result known to
    map makers for quite some time that says that 4 colors are always sufficient
    to color the nations on a map in such a way that countries sharing a boundary
    are always colored differently. <span>&lt;&lt;Unresolved xref, reference "fig_Lux_map"; check spelling or use "provisional" attribute&gt;&gt;</span> shows one instance
    of an arrangement of nations that requires at least four different colors,
    the theorem says that four colors are <!--Style me with CSS--><em>always</em> enough. It should be noted
    that real cartographers usually reserve a fifth color for oceans (and other
    water) and that it is possible to conceive of a map requiring five colors if
    one allows the nations to be non-contiguous. In 1977,
     Kenneth Appel and
    Wolfgang Haken proved the four color
    theorem by reducing the infinitude of possibilities to
    1,936 separate cases and analyzing each of these with a computer.
    The inelegance of a proof by cases is probably proportional to some power of
    the number of cases, but in any case, this proof is generally considered
    somewhat inelegant. Ever since the proof was announced there has been an
    ongoing effort to reduce the number of cases (currently the record is 633
    cases — still far too many to be checked through without a computer) or to
    find a proof that does not rely on cases. For a good introductory article on
    the four color theorem see <a knowl="./knowl/wiki-4color.html" knowl-id="xref-wiki-4color" alt="Bibliographic Entry 6 " title="Bibliographic Entry 6 ">[6]</a>.
