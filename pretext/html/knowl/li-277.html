          Prove that every prime number other than 2 and 3 has the form
          \(6q+1\) or \(6q+5\) for some integer \(q\).  (Hint: this problem involves
          thinking about cases as well as contrapositives.)

          \hint{It is probably obvious that the "cases" will be the possible remainders mod 6. Numbers of the form 6q+0 will be multiples of 6, so clearly not prime. The other forms that need to be eliminated are 6q+2, 6q+3, and 6q+4.
