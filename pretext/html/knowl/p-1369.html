    By specifying a particular ordering (strictly increasing) on the sequences
    we are counting above, we are actually removing the importance of order.
    Put another way: if order really mattered, the symbols \(1\) through \(6\)
    could be put into \(720\) different orders â€” but we only want to count
    one of those possibilities. Put another other way: there is a one-to-one
    correspondence between a \(6\)-subset of \(\{1,2,3, \ldots 20\}\) and a
    strictly increasing sequence. Just make sure the subset is written in
    increasing order!
