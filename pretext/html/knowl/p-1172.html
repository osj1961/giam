    Probably the most important equivalence relation we've seen to date
    is “congruence mod \(m\)” which we will denote using the symbol \(\equiv_m\).
    This relation may even be more interesting than
    actual equality! The reason for this seemingly odd statement is that
    “congruence mod \(m\)” gives us non-trivial  equivalence classes. Equivalence
    classes are one of the most potent ideas in modern mathematics and it's essential
    that you understand them, so we'll start with an example. Consider congruence
    mod \(5\). What other numbers is (say) 11 equivalent to? There are many! Any
    number that leaves the same remainder as 11 when we divide it by 5. This collection
    is called the equivalence class of 11 and is usually denoted using an overline —
    \(\overline{11}\), another notation that is often seen for the set of things equivalent
    to 11 is \(11/\equiv_5\).
    \begin{equation*}
      \overline{11} = \{ \ldots, -9, -4, 1, 6, 11, 16, \ldots \}
    \end{equation*}
