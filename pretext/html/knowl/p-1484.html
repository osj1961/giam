    Earlier in this chapter we determined the number of \(k\)-subsets of a set
    of size \(n\). These numbers, denoted by \(C(n,k) = nCk = \binom{n}{k}\)
    and determined by the formula \(\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\) are known as binomial
    coefficients. It seems likely that you will have already seen the arrangement
    of these binomial coefficients into a triangular array — known as
     Pascal's triangle, but if not…
