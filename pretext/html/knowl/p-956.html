        It is a good idea to write down somewhere just what it is that
        needs to be proved in the inductive step — just don't make it look like 
        you're assuming what needs to be shown.  For instance in the proof above
        it might have been nice to start the inductive step with a comment along
        the following lines, “What we need to show is that under the assumption
        that any set of size \(k\) has a power set of size \(2^k\), it follows that
        a set of size \(k+1\) will have a power set of size \(2^{k+1}\).”
