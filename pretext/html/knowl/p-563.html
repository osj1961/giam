    Now, if you followed the algebra above, (none of which was particularly
    difficult) the proof stands as a completely valid argument showing the
    truth of our proposition, but this is <!--Style me with CSS--><em>very</em> unsatisfying! All
    the real work was concealed in one stark little sentence:
    “Let \(k\) be \(a^2+3a+1\).” Where on Earth did that particular value
    of \(k\) come from? The answer to that question should hopefully
    convince you that there is a huge difference between <!--Style me with CSS--><em>devising</em>
    a proof and <!--Style me with CSS--><em>writing</em> one. A good proof can sometimes be
    somewhat akin to a good demonstration of magic, a magician doesn't
    reveal the inner workings of his trick, neither should a mathematician
    feel guilty about leaving out some of the details behind the work!
    Heck, there are plenty of times when you just have to <!--Style me with CSS--><em>guess</em>
    at something, but if your guess works out, you can write
    a perfectly correct proof.
