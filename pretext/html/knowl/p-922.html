    Now within the universal set we're working in (the set of all sets) there
    are only two possibilities: a given set is either in \({\mathcal S}\) or
    it is in its complement \(\overline{\mathcal S}\). Russell's paradox
    comes about when we try to decide which of these alternatives pertains
    to \({\mathcal S}\) itself, the problem is that each alternative leads us
    to the other!
