    Paper media was ideally suited to storing binary information, but of course
    most of the real data people needed to store and process would be
    alphanumeric<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-47" id="fn-47"><span class="footnote"><sup> 1 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-47" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">“Alphanumeric” is a somewhat
    antiquated term that refers to information containing both alphabetic 
    characters and numeric characters — as well as punctuation marks, etc.</span></span>.
    There were several encoding schemes that served to translate between the
    character sets that people commonly used and the binary numerals that could
    be stored on paper. One of these schemes still survives today — ASCII.
    The American Standard Code for Information Interchange uses 7-bit binary
    numerals to represent characters, so it contains 128 different symbols.
    This is more than enough to represent both upper- and lower-case
    letters, the 10 numerals, and the punctuation marks — many of the
    remaining spots in the ASCII code were used to contain so-called
    “control characters” that were associated with functionality that
    appeared on old-fashioned teletype equipment — things like “ring the bell,”
    “move the carriage backwards one space,” “move the carriage
    to the next line,” etc. These control characters are why modern
    keyboards still have a modifier key labeled “Ctrl” on them. The
    following listing gives the decimal and binary numerals from 0 to 127
    and the ASCII characters associated with them — the non-printing and
    control characters have a 2 or 3 letter mnemonic designation.
