    This is an instance of a counting problem where we are selecting 8 things
    out of a set of size 94 â€” clearly order is important and the system
    administrator's restriction means that we may not have repeats.
    The multiplication rule tells us that there are
    \(94\cdot 93\cdot 92\cdot 91\cdot 90\cdot 89\cdot 88\cdot 87 = 4488223369069440\)
    different passwords. And in the general case (selecting \(k\) things out
    of a set of size \(n\), without repetition, and with order counting)
    there will be \(n!/(n-k)!\) possibilities. This is the number we have
    denoted previously by \(P(n,k)\).
