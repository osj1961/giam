    Recall that in Logic the atomic concepts were “true”, “false”,
    “sentence” and “statement.” In Set theory, they are “set”,
    “element” and “membership.” These concepts (more or less) correspond to
    one another. In most books, a set is denoted either using the letter \(M\)
    (which stands for the German word “menge”) or early alphabet capital roman
    letters — \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), <!--Style me with CSS--><em>et cetera</em>. Here, we will often emphasize the connection between
    sets and open sentences in Logic by using a subscript notation. The set that
    corresponds to the open sentence \(P(x)\) will be denoted \(S_P\), we call
    \(S_P\) the  <!--Style me with CSS--><em>truth set</em> of \(P(x)\).
    \begin{equation*}
      S_P = \{ x \suchthat P(x) \}
    \end{equation*}
