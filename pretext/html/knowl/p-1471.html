    We can come up with stronger forms of the pigeonhole principle by
    considering pigeonholes with capacities. Suppose we have 6 pigeonholes
    in a desk, each of which can hold 10 letters. What number of letters will
    guarantee that one of the pigeonholes is full? The largest number of letters
    we could have without having 10 in some pigeonhole is \(9 \cdot 6 = 54\), so if
    there are 55 letters we must have 10 letters in some pigeonhole.
