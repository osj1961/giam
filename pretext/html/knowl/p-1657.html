    The generalized continuum hypothesis says that the power set construction
    is basically the only way to get from one infinite cardinality to the next.
    In other words GCH says that not only does \({\mathcal P}(\Naturals)\) have the
    cardinality known as \(\aleph_1\), but every other aleph number can be realized
    by applying the power set construction a bunch of times. Some people would
    express this symbolically by writing
    \begin{equation*}
      \forall n \in \Naturals,  \aleph_{n+1} = 2^{\aleph_n}.
    \end{equation*}
