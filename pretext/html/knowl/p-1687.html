          In this section we talked about similarity.  Two figures in 
          the plane are 
          similar if it is possible to turn one into the other
          by a sequence of mappings: a translation, a rotation and a scaling.  

          Geometric similarity is an equivalence relation.  To fix our
          notation, let \(T(x,y)\) represent a generic translation, \(R(x,y)\) a rotation
          and \(S(x,y)\) a scaling — thus a generic similarity is a function from
          \(\Reals^2\) to \(\Reals^2\) that can be written in the form \(S(R(T(x,y)))\).

          Discuss the three properties of an equivalence relation (reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity) in terms of geometric similarity.
