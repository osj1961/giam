    Let's start by considering the set \(P = \Reals \times \Reals\) — i.e.
    \(P\) is the \(x\)–\(y\) plane. There are two functions, whose domain is \(P\)
    that “pick out” the \(x\), and/or \(y\) coordinate. These functions are
    called \(\pi_1\) and \(\pi_2\), \(\pi_1\) is the projection onto the first
    coordinate and \(\pi_2\) is the projection onto the second coordinate.<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-42" id="fn-42"><span class="footnote"><sup> 2 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-42" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">Don't think of the usual \(\pi \approx 3.14159\) when looking at \(\pi_1\) and 
    \(\pi_2\).  These functions are named as they are because \(\pi\) is the Greek 
    letter corresponding to `p' which stands for “projection.”</span></span>
