      Suppose that there is a set \(A\) that can be placed in one-to-one
      correspondence with its power set. Then there is a bijective
      function \(f : A \longrightarrow {\mathcal P}(A)\). We will deduce
      a contradiction by constructing a subset of \(A\)
      (i.e. a member of \({\mathcal P}(A))\) that cannot
      be in the range of \(f\).
    </p>
<p>
      Let \(S = \{x \in A \suchthat x \notin f(x)\}\).
    </p>
<p>
      If \(S\) is in the range of \(f\), there is a preimage \(y\) such that \(S = f(y)\).
      But, if such a \(y\) exists then the membership question, \(y \in S\), must
      either be true or false. If \(y \in S\), then because \(S = f(y)\), and \(S\)
      consists of those elements that are not in their images, it follows
      that \(y \notin S\). On the other hand, if \(y \notin S\) then \(y \notin f(y)\) so
      (by the definition of \(S\)) it follows that \(y \in S\). Either possibility leads to the other, which is a contradiction.
