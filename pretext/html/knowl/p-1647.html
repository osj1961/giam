    From these decimal expansions, we can create the decimal expansion of
    a number in \(I\) by interleaving the digits of \(a\) and \(b\). Let
    \begin{equation*}
      s = 0.a_1b_1a_2b_2a_3b_3 \ldots
    \end{equation*}
    be the image of \((a, b)\). If two different points get mapped to the same
    value \(s\) then both points have \(x\) and \(y\) coordinates that agree in
    every position of
    their decimal expansion (so they must really be equal).
    It is a little bit harder to create a bijective function from \(S\) to \(I\)
    (and thus
    to show the equivalence directly, without appealing to C-B-S). The problem
    is that, once again, we need to deal with the non-uniqueness of decimal
    representations of real numbers. If we make the choice that, whenever there
    is a choice to be made, we will use the non-terminating decimal expansions
    for our real numbers there will be elements of \(I\) not in the image of the map
    determined by interleaving digits (for example \(0.15401050902060503\) is the
    interleaving of the digits after the decimal point in
    \(\pi = 3.141592653\ldots\) and \(1/2 = 0.5\), this is clearly an element of
    \(I\) but it can't be in the image of our
    map since \(1/2\) should be represented by \(0.4\overline{9}\) according to
    our convention. If
    we try other conventions for dealing with the non-uniqueness it is possible
    to find other examples that show simple interleaving will not be surjective.
    A slightly more subtle approach is required.
