        Prove that 
        \(A \cup (B \cap C) = (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C)\) by showing that 
        \(A \cup (B \cap C) \subseteq (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C)\) and 
        \((A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C) \subseteq A \cup (B \cap C)\).

        \hint{This exercise, as well as the previous one, is really just about converting set-theoretic
        statements into their logical equivalents, applying some rules of logic that we've already verified,
        and then returning to a set-theoretic version of things.}
