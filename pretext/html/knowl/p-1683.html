    The triangles (these are the larger obtuse ones) that appear purple in <span>&lt;&lt;Unresolved xref, reference "fig_morley_conway_puzzle"; check spelling or use "provisional" attribute&gt;&gt;</span> are
    a bit more puzzling. Ostensibly, we have two different jobs to accomplish — we must scale them so that both of the edges that they will share
    with green triangles have the correct lengths. How do we know
    that this won't require two different scaling factors? Conway also
    developed an elegant argument that handles this question as well.
    Consider the purple triangle at the bottom of the
    diagram in <span>&lt;&lt;Unresolved xref, reference "fig_morley_conway_puzzle"; check spelling or use "provisional" attribute&gt;&gt;</span> — it has vertex
    angles \((a,b,c^{\star\star})\). It is possible to construct triangles
    similar (via reflections) to the adjacent green triangles
    \((a, b^\star, c^\star)\) and \((a^\star, b, c^\star)\) <!--Style me with CSS--><em>inside</em> of
    triangle \((a,b,c^{\star\star})\). To do this just construct two lines that
    go through the top vertex (where the angle \(c^{\star\star}\) is) that cut
    the opposite edge at the angle \(c^\star\) in the two possible senses — these two lines
    will coincide if it should happen that \(c^\star\) is precisely \(\pi/2\)
    but generally there will be two and it is evident that the two line
    segments formed have the same length. We scale the purple triangle so
    that this common length will be 1. See <span>&lt;&lt;Unresolved xref, reference "fig_morley_conway_puzzle_scaling"; check spelling or use "provisional" attribute&gt;&gt;</span>.
