    To show that the integers are actually equinumerous with the natural
    numbers (which is what we're about to do â€” and by the way, isn't that pretty
    remarkable?) we need, essentially, to figure out a way to list the integers in
    a singly infinite list. Using the symbol \(\pm\) we can arrange for a singly infinite
    listing, and if you think about what the symbol \(\pm\) means you'll probably
    come up with
    \begin{equation*}
      \Integers \; = \; \{0, 1, -1, 2, -2, 3, -3, \ldots \}.
    \end{equation*}
