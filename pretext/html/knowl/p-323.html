    The <!--Style me with CSS--><em>associative laws</em> also have something to do with what order operations
    are done. One could think of the difference in the following terms:
    Commutative properties
    involve spatial or physical order and the associative properties involve
    temporal order. The associative law of addition could be used to say we'll
    get the same result if we add 2 and 3 first, then add 4, or if we add 2 to the
    sum of 3 and 4 (i.e. that \((2+3)+4\) is the same as \(2+(3+4)\).) Note that
    physically, the numbers are in the same order (2 then 3 then 4) in both
    expressions but that the parentheses indicate a precedence in <!--Style me with CSS--><em>when</em> the
    plus signs are evaluated.
