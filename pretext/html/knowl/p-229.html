    One of the principle ways in which mathematical writing
    differs from ordinary writing is in its incredible brevity. For
    instance, a Ph.D. thesis for someone in the humanities would be very
    suspicious if its length were less than 300 pages, whereas it would
    be quite acceptable for a math doctoral student to submit a thesis
    amounting to less than 100 pages. Indeed, the usual criteria for
    a doctoral thesis (or indeed any scholarly work in mathematics) is
    that it be “new, true and interesting.” If one can prove a truly
    interesting, novel result in a single page — they'll probably hand over
    the sheepskin.
