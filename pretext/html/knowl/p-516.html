    An argument is said to be <!--Style me with CSS--><em>valid</em> or to have a
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>valid form</em>
    if each deduction in it can be justified with one of the rules
    of inference listed in the previous section. The <!--Style me with CSS--><em>form</em> of
    an argument might be valid, but still the conclusion may be false
    if some of the premises are false. So to show that an argument is
    good we have to be able to do two things: show that the argument
    is <!--Style me with CSS--><em>valid</em> (i.e. that every step can be justified) and that
    the argument is
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>sound</em>
    which means that all the premises are
    true. If you start off with a false premise, you can prove <!--Style me with CSS--><em>anything</em>!
