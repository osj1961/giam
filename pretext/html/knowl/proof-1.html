<p>
      Suppose to the contrary that \(\sqrt{2}\) <!--Style me with CSS--><em>is</em> a rational number.
      Then by the definition of the set of rational numbers, we know that
      there are integers
      \(a\) and \(b\) having the following properties:
      \(\displaystyle \sqrt{2} = \frac{a}{b}\) and \(\gcd{a}{b} = 1\).
    </p>
<p>
      Consider the expression \(\displaystyle \sqrt{2} = \frac{a}{b}\).
      By squaring both sides of this we obtain
      \begin{equation*}
        2 = \frac{a^2}{b^2}.
      \end{equation*}
    </p>
<p>
      This last expression can be rearranged to give
      \begin{equation*}
        a^2 = 2 b^2
      \end{equation*}
    </p>
<p>
      An immediate consequence of this last equation is that \(a^2\) is an
      even number. Using the lemma above we now know that \(a\) is an even
      integer and hence that there is an integer \(m\) such that \(a=2m\).
      Substituting this last expression into the previous equation gives
      \begin{equation*}
        (2m)^2 = 2 b^2,
      \end{equation*}
      thus,
      \begin{equation*}
        4m^2 = 2 b^2,
      \end{equation*}
      so
      \begin{equation*}
        2m^2 = b^2.
      \end{equation*}
    </p>
<p>
      This tells us that \(b^2\) is even, and hence (by the lemma), \(b\) is even.
    </p>
<p>
      Finally, we have arrived at the desired absurdity because if \(a\) and
      \(b\) are both even then \(\gcd{a}{b} \geq 2\), but, on the other hand,
      one of our initial assumptions is that \(\gcd{a}{b} = 1\).
