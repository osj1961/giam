    In the 17th century, Pierre de Fermat
    made the conjecture<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-15" id="fn-15"><span class="footnote"><sup> 1 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-15" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">Fermat's 
    more famous conjecture, that \(x^n+y^n=z^n\) has no non-trivial integer solutions
    if \(n\) is an integer with \(n&gt;2\) was discovered after his death.</span></span> that
    \(\forall x \in {\mathbb N}, P(x)\). No doubt, this seemed reasonable to Fermat
    because the numbers given by this formula (they are called
    Fermat numbers in
    his honor) are all primes — at first! Fermat numbers are conventionally
    denoted with a subscripted letter F, \(F_n = 2^{2^n}+1\), the first five
    Fermat numbers are prime.
