    We'll close this section with a word about axioms. The axioms in any
    given area of math are your most fundamental tools. Axioms don't
    need to be proved — we are supposed to just accept them! A very common
    problem for beginning proofwriters is telling the difference between statements
    that are axiomatic and statements that require some proof. For instance, in the
    exercises for this section there is a problem that asks us to prove that the sum of
    two rational numbers is rational. Doesn't this seem like it might be one of
    the axioms of rational numbers? Is it really something that <!--Style me with CSS--><em>can</em> be proved?
    Well, we know how the process of adding rational numbers works: we put the
    fractions over a common
    denominator and then just add numerators. Do you see how adding fractions really rests
    on our ability to add the numerators (which are integers). So, in doing that exercise you
    can use the fact (indeed, you'll need to use the fact) that the sum of two integers is an integer.
    So how about <!--Style me with CSS--><em>that</em> statement? Is it necessary to prove that adding integers produces
    an integer? As a matter of fact it <!--Style me with CSS--><em>is</em> necessary since the structure of the integers
    rests on a foundation known as the Peano axioms for the naturals — and the Peano axioms
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>don't</em> include one that guarantees that the sum of two naturals is also a natural. If you
    are tempted to trace this whole thing back, to “find out how deep the rabbit hole goes,” I commend
    you. But, if you just want to be able to get on with doing your homework problems, I sympathize
    with that sentiment too. Let's agree that integers behave the way we've come to expect — if
    you add or multiply integers the result will be an integer.
