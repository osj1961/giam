    Perhaps you tried to prove this result earlier. If so you probably
    came across the conceptual problem that all you have to work with
    is the evenness of \(x^2\) which doesn't give you much ammunition
    in trying to show that \(x\) is even. The contrapositive of this
    statement is:
    \begin{equation*}
      \forall x \in \Integers, \; x \, \mbox{not even}  \; 
      \implies x^2 \, \mbox{not even}
    \end{equation*}
