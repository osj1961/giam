           Rational Approximation is 
          a field of mathematics that has received much study.  The main idea 
          is to find rational numbers that are very good approximations to
          given irrationals.  For example, \(22/7\) is a well-known rational 
          approximation to \(\pi\).  Find good rational approximations to 
          \(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5}\) and \(e\).





          \hint{One approach is to truncate a decimal approximation and then rationalize. E.g. \(\sqrt{2}\) is approximately 1.4142, so 14142/10000 isn't a bad approximator (although naturally 7071/5000 is better since it involves smaller numbers).}
