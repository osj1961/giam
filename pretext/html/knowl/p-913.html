    In all likelihood, Nobel simply didn't view mathematics as a field
    which provides benefits for mankind — at least not directly.
    The broadest division within mathematics is between the “pure”
    and “applied” branches. Just precisely where the dividing line
    between these spheres lies is a matter of opinion, but it can be
    argued that it is so far to one side that one may as well call an
    applied mathematician a physicist
    (or chemist, or biologist, or economist, or …). One thing is
    clear, Nobel believed to a certain extent in the utilitarian ethos.
    The value of a thing (or a person) is determined by how useful it is (or they
    are), which makes it interesting that one of the few mathematicians
    to win a Nobel prize was Bertrand Russell (the 1950 prize in Literature
    “in recognition of his varied and significant writings in which he
    champions humanitarian ideals and freedom of thought”).
