          Consider the game called “binary determinant tic-tac-toe”  
          which is played by two players who alternately fill in the entries of a 
          \(3 \times 3\) array.  Player One goes first, placing 1's in the array and 
          player Zero goes second, placing 0's.  Player One's goal is that the 
          final array have determinant 1, and player Zero's goal is that the 
          determinant be 0.  The determinant calculations are carried out mod 2.

          Show that player Zero can always win a game of binary determinant tic-tac-toe
          by the method of exhaustion.

          \hint{If you know something about determinants it would help here.  The determinant will be
          0 if there are two identical rows (or columns) in the finished array.  Also, if there is a row or column
          that is all zeros, player Zero wins too.  Also, cyclically permuting either rows or columns has no effect
          on the determinant of a binary array.  This means we lose no generality in assuming player One's
          first move goes (say) in the upper-left corner.}
