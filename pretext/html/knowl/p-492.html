    Like an inductive argument, a deductive argument
    is essentially just a
    long sequence of statements; but there is some additional structure.
    The last statement in the list is the <!--Style me with CSS--><em>conclusion</em> — the statement
    to be proved — those occurring before it are known as
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>premises</em>.
    Premises may be further subdivided into (at least) five sorts: axioms,
    definitions, previously proved theorems, hypotheses and deductions.
    Axioms and definitions are often glossed
    over, indeed, they often go completely unmentioned (but rarely <!--Style me with CSS--><em>unused</em>)
    in a proof. In the interest of brevity this is quite appropriate, but
    conceptually, you should think of an argument as being based off of
    the axioms for the particular area you are working in, and its standard
    definitions. A rote knowledge of all the other theorems proved up to
    the one you are working with would generally be considered excessive,
    but completely memorizing the axioms and standard definitions of a field
    is essential. Hypotheses are a funny class of premises — they are things
    which can be assumed true for the sake of the current argument. For
    example, if the statement you are trying to prove is a conditional,
    then the antecedent may be assumed true (if the antecedent is false,
    then the conditional is automatically true!). You should always be
    careful to list all hypotheses explicitly, and at the end of your
    proof make sure that each and every hypothesis got used somewhere
    along the way. If a hypothesis really isn't necessary then you have
    proved a more general statement (that's a good thing).
