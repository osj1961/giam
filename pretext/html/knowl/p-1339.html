    Let's start by counting the permutations of \(\{1, 2, 3\}\).
    A permutation will be a 3-tuple containing the numbers \(1\), \(2\) and
    \(3\) in some order. We will think about building such a thing in
    three stages. First,
    we must select a number to go in the first position — there are \(3\) choices.
    Having made that choice, there will only be two possibilities for the number
    in the second position. Finally there is just one number remaining to put in
    the third position<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-43" id="fn-43"><span class="footnote"><sup> 1 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-43" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">People may say you have “no choice” in this 
    last situation, but what they mean is that you have only one choice.</span></span>.
    Thus there are \(3\cdot 2\cdot 1 = 6\) permutations of a \(3\) element set.
