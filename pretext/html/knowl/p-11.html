    This is a good time to start building a “glossary” — a translation lexicon
    between the symbols of mathematics and plain language. In the line
    above we are defining the set \(\Rationals\) of rational numbers, so the
    first symbols that appear are “\(\Rationals =\).” It is interesting to
    note that the equals sign has two subtly different meanings: assignment
    and equality testing, in the mathematical sentence above we are
    making an assignment — that is, we are declaring that from now on the set
    \(\Rationals\) will <!--Style me with CSS--><em>be</em> the set defined on the remainder of the
    line.<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-2" id="fn-2"><span class="footnote"><sup> 2 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-2" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">Some Mathematicians contend that only the “equality
      test” meaning of the equals sign is real, that by writing the
      mathematical sentence above we are asserting the truth of the
      equality test.  This may be technically correct but it isn't how
      most people think of things.</span></span>
    Let's dissect the rest of that line now. There are only 4
    characters whose meaning may be in doubt, \(\{\), \(\}\), \(\in\) and \(\suchthat\).
    The curly braces (a.k.a. <!--Style me with CSS--><em>french braces</em>) are almost universally
    reserved to denote sets, anything appearing between curly braces is
    meant to define a set. In translating from “math” to English,
    replace the initial brace with the phrase “the set of all.” The
    next arcane symbol to appear is the vertical bar. As we will see in
    <a href="sec_num_thry.html#div" alt="Subsection 1.4.3 Divisibility" title="Subsection 1.4.3 Divisibility">Section 1.4.3</a> this symbol has (at least) two meanings — it will
    always be clear from context which is meant. In the sentence we are
    analyzing, it stands for the words “such that.” The last bit of
    arcana to be deciphered is the symbol \(\in\), it stands for the English
    word “in” or, more formally, “is an element of.”
