<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>
    How is this great brevity achieved? By inserting single symbols in place
    of a whole paragraph's worth of words! One class of symbols in particular
    has immense power — so-called  relational symbols.
    When you place a relational
    symbol between two expressions, you create a sentence that says the
    relation <!--Style me with CSS--><em>holds</em>. The period at the end of the last sentence should
    probably be pronounced! “The relation holds, period!” In other words
    when you write down a mathematical sentence involving a relation, you
    are asserting the relation is True (the capital T is intentional).
    This is why it's okay to write “\(2 \lt  3\)” but it's <!--Style me with CSS--><em>not</em> okay to
    write “\(3 \lt  2\).” The symbol \(\lt\) is a relation symbol and you are
    only supposed to put it between two things when they actually bear this
    relation to one another.
