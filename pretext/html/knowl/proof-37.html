      (By strong induction)
      Consider an arbitrary natural number \(n&gt;1\). If \(n\) is prime then \(n\) clearly
      has a prime factor (itself), so suppose that \(n\) is not prime. By
      definition, a composite
      natural number can be factored, so \(n=a \cdot b\) for some pair of natural
      numbers \(a\) and \(b\) which are both greater than 1. Since \(a\) and \(b\) are
      factors of \(n\) both greater than 1, it follows that \(a \lt  n\) (it is also
      true that \(b \lt  n\) but we don't need that â€¦). The inductive hypothesis
      can now be applied to deduce that \(a\) has a prime factor \(p\). Since
      \(p \divides a\) and \(a \divides n\), by transitivity \(p \divides n\). Thus
      \(n\) has a prime factor.
