    Okay, so category theory won't be of much
    use to you until much later in your mathematical career (if at all), and
    one could argue that it doesn't really save that much effort. Why not just do two or three different
    proofs instead of learning a whole new field so we can combine
    them into one? Nevertheless, category theory is being
    mentioned here at the beginning of the chapter on sets. Why?
