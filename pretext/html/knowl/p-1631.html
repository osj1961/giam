    To develop an injection from \({\mathbb F}_2^\infty\) to \((0, 1)\) we'll use “room number 1” to
    separate the binary expansions that represent the same real number. Move
    all the digits of a binary expansion down by one, and make the first digit
    \(0\) for (say) the terminating expansions and \(1\) for the non-terminating ones.
    Now consider these expansions as real numbers — all the expansions that
    previously coincided are now separated into the intervals \((0, 1/2)\) and
    \((1/2, 1)\). Notice how funny this map is, there are now
    many, many, (infinitely-many)
    real numbers with no preimages. For instance, only a subset of the rational
    numbers in \((0, 1/2)\) have preimages. Nevertheless, the map is injective, so
    C-B-S tells us that \({\mathbb F}_2^\infty\) and \((0, 1)\) are equivalent.
    There are quite a few different proofs of the C-B-S theorem. The one
    Cantor himself wrote relies on the axiom of choice. The axiom of choice
    was somewhat controversial when it was introduced, but these days most
    mathematicians will use it without qualms. What it says (essentially) is that
    it is possible to make an infinite number of choices. More precisely, it says
    that if we have an infinite set consisting of non-empty sets, it is possible
    to select an element out of each set. If there is a definable rule for picking
    such an element (as is the case, for example, when we selected the
    nonterminating decimal expansion whenever there was a choice in defining the
    injection from \((0, 1)\) to \({\mathbb F}_2^\infty\)) the axiom of choice
    isn't needed. The usual
    axioms for set theory were developed by Zermelo and Frankel, so you may
    hear people speak of the ZF axioms. If, in addition, we want to specifically
    allow the axiom of choice, we are in the ZFC axiom system. If it's possible
    to construct a proof for a given theorem without using the axiom of choice,
    almost everyone would agree that that is preferable. On the other hand,
    a proof of the C-B-S theorem, which necessarily must be able to deal with
    uncountably infinite sets, will have to depend on some sort of notion that
    will allow us to deal with huge infinities.
