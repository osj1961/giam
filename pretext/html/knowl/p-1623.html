    We've said a lot about the equivalence relation
    determined by Cantor's definition
    of set equivalence. We've also, occasionally, written things like
    \(|A| \lt  |B|\), without being particularly clear about what that means.
    It's now time to come clean. There is actually a (perhaps) more fundamental
    notion used for comparing set sizes than equivalence — dominance.
    Dominance is an ordering relation on the class of all sets.
    One should probably really define dominance first and then
    define set equivalence in terms of it. We haven't followed that plan
    for (at least) two reasons. First, many people may want to skip this
    section — the results of this section depend on the difficult
    Cantor-Bernstein-Schröder theorem<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-57" id="fn-57"><span class="footnote"><sup> 1 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-57" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">This theorem has been 
    known for many years as the Schröder-Bernstein theorem, but, 
    lately, has had Cantor's name added as well. Since Cantor proved 
    the result before the other gentlemen this is fitting. It is also 
    known as the Cantor-Bernstein theorem (leaving out Schröder) 
    which doesn't seem very nice.</span></span>. Second, we will later take the view that dominance
    should really be considered to be an ordering relation on the set of
    all cardinal numbers — i.e. the equivalence classes of the set equivalence
    relation — not on the collection of all sets. From that perspective,
    set equivalence really needs to be defined <!--Style me with CSS--><em>before</em> dominance.
