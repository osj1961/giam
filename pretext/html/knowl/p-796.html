    Now to many people (me included!) this looks funny at first, \(\subseteq\)
    in Set theory corresponds to \(\implies\) in Logic. It seems like both
    of these symbols are arrows of a sort — but they point in opposite
    directions! Personally, I resolve the apparent discrepancy by thinking
    about the “strength” of logical predicates. One predicate is stronger
    than another if it puts more conditions on the elements that would make
    it true. For example, “\(x\) is doubly-even” is stronger than
    “\(x\) is (merely) even.” Now, the stronger statement implies the weaker
    (assuming of course that they are stronger and weaker versions of the
    same idea). If a number is doubly-even (i.e. divisible by 4) then it
    is certainly even — but the converse is certainly not true, \(6\) is even
    but <!--Style me with CSS--><em>not</em> doubly-even. Think of all this in terms of sets now.
    Which set contains the other, the set of doubly-even numbers or the set
    of even numbers? Clearly the set that corresponds to more stringent
    membership criteria is smaller than the set that corresponds
    to less restrictive criteria, thus the set defined by a weak membership
    criterion contains the one having a stronger criterion.
