    There are some notions within Set theory that don't have any clear
    parallels in Logic. One of these is essentially a generalization
    of the concept of “complements.” If you think of the set \(\overline{A}\)
    as being the difference between the universal set \(U\) and the set \(A\)
    you are on the right track. The
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>difference</em> between two sets is written
    \(A \setminus B\) (sadly, sometimes this is denoted using the ordinary
    subtraction symbol \(A-B\)) and is defined by
    \begin{equation*}
      A \setminus B = A \cap \overline{B}.
    \end{equation*}
