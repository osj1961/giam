    We'll end this section with a function that will be especially important
    in <a href="ch_card.html" alt="Chapter 8 Cardinality" title="Chapter 8 Cardinality">Chapter 8</a>. If we have an arbitrary subset of the natural
    numbers, we can associate it with an infinite string of 0's and 1's. By
    sticking a decimal point in front of such a thing, we get binary notation
    for a real number in the interval \([0,1]\). There is a subtle problem that
    we'll deal with when we study this function in more detail in <a href="ch_card.html" alt="Chapter 8 Cardinality" title="Chapter 8 Cardinality">Chapter 8</a> — some real numbers can be expressed in two different ways in base 2.
    For example, \(1/2\) can either be written as \(.1\) or as \(.0\overline{1}\) (where,
    as usual, the overline indicates a pattern that repeats forever).
    For the moment, we are talking about
    defining a function \(\phi\) whose domain is \({\mathcal P}(\Naturals)\) and
    whose codomain is the set of all infinite binary strings.
    Let us denote these binary expansions by
    \(.b_1b_2b_3b_4\ldots\). Suppose \(A\) is a subset of \(\Naturals\),
    then the binary expansion associated with \(A\) will be
    determined by \(b_i = 1_A(i)\). (Alternatively, we can use the Iverson
    bracket notation: \(b_i = [i \in A]\).)
