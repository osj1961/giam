        Sometimes in constructing a proof we find it necessary to “weaken” an inequality.  For example,
        we might have already deduced that \(x \lt  y\) but what we need in our argument is that \(x \leq y\).  It is
        okay to deduce \(x \leq y\) from \(x \lt  y\) because the former is just shorthand for \(x\lt y \lor x=y\).  What
        rule of inference are we using in order to deduce that \(x \leq y\) is true in this situation?
