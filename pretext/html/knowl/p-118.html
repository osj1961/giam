      In the next section we'll discuss the so-called division algorithm â€” this may be over-kill since you certainly already know how to do
      division! Indeed, in the U.S., long division is usually first studied
      in the latter half of elementary school, and division problems that
      don't involve a remainder may be found as early as the first grade.
      Nevertheless, we're going to discuss this process in sordid detail
      because it gives us a good setting in which to prove relatively easy
      statements. Suppose you are setting-up a long division problem in
      which the integer \(n\) is being divided by a positive divisor \(d\).
      (If you want to divide by a negative number, just divide by the
      corresponding positive number and then throw an extra minus sign
      on at the end.)
