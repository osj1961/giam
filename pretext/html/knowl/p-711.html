          Find the pebbling number of a graph whose nodes are the corners and 
          whose edges are the, uhmm, edges of a cube.

          \hint{It should be clear that the pebbling number is at least \(8\) — \(7\) pebbles could be distributed, 
          one to a node, and the \(8\)th node would be unreachable.  It will be easier to play around with this if
          you figure out how to draw the cube graph “flattened-out” in the plane.}
