            Either Wellington is a knave or Wellington is a knight.
          </p>
<p>
            \text{ It's either one thing or the other! }
          </p>
<p>
            If Wellington is a knight it follows that Bonaparte is a knight.
          </p>
<p>
            \text{ That's what he said he would tell us and if he's a knight we can trust him. }
          </p>
<p>
            If Bonaparte is a knight then Wellington is a knave.
          </p>
<p>
            \text{ True, because that is one of the things Bonaparte states. }
          </p>
<p>
            So, if Wellington is a knight then Wellington is a knave (which is impossible!)
          </p>
<p>
            \text{ This is just summing up what was deduced above. }
          </p>
<p>
            Thus, Wellington is a knave.
          </p>
<p>
            \text{ Because the other possibility leads to something <!--Style me with CSS--><em>im</em>possible. }
          </p>
<p>
            Since Wellington is a knave, his statement “I would tell you that Bonaparte is a knight” is false.
          </p>
<p>
            \text{ Knave's statements are always false! }
          </p>
<p>
            So Wellington would in fact tell us that Bonaparte is a knave.
          </p>
<p>
            \text{ He was lying when he said he would tell us B is a knight. }
          </p>
<p>
            Since Wellington is a knave we conclude that Bonaparte is a knight.
          </p>
<p>
            \text{ Wait, now I'm confused… can you do this part? }
          </p>
<p>
            Thus Bonaparte is a knight and Wellington is a knave (as claimed).
          </p>
<p>
            \text{ Just summarizing. }
