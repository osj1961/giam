    Each row of the above table represents a possible state of the outside
    world. Suppose you observe the conditions given in the last row, namely
    that it is neither sunny, nor is it raining — you would certainly conclude
    that I am not to be trusted. I.e. my statement, the compounding of
    “The sun is shining” and “It is raining” (with the word “but” in between
    as a connector) is false. If you think about it a bit, you'll agree that
    this so-called <!--Style me with CSS--><em>compound sentence</em> is true
    only in the case that both
    of its component pieces are true. This underscores an amusing linguistic
    point: “but” and “and” have exactly the same meaning! More precisely,
    they <!--Style me with CSS--><em>denote</em> the same thing, they have subtly different connotations
    however — “but” indicates that both of the statements it connects
    are true and that the speaker is surprised by this state of affairs.
