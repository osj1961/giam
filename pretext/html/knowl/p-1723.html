    Monge's circle theorem has
    nothing to do with matchsticks, but it is a
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>sweet</em> example of a proof that works by moving to a higher dimension.
    People often talk about “thinking outside of the box” when discussing
    critical thinking, but the mathematical idea of moving to a higher dimension
    is even more powerful. When we have a “box” in 2-dimensional space which
    we then regard as sitting in a 3-dimensional space we find that the box
    doesn't even <!--Style me with CSS--><em>have</em> an inside or an outside anymore! We get “outside
    the box” by literally erasing the notion that there <!--Style me with CSS--><em>is</em> an inside
    of the box!
