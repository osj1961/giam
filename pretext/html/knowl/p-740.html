    This set has a very nice geometric character that often doesn't receive the
    attention it deserves. Every element of a \(\Integers\)-module generated
    by two numbers (\(15\) and \(21\) in the example)
    corresponds to a point in the Euclidean plane. As indicated in
    <span>&lt;&lt;Unresolved xref, reference "fig_zmodule"; check spelling or use "provisional" attribute&gt;&gt;</span> there is a dividing line between the positive
    and negative elements in a \(\Integers\)-module. It is also easy to see
    that there are many repetitions of the same value at different points
    in the plane.
