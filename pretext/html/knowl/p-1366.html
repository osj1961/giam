    This is also a case that we've considered previously. If we are choosing
    \(k\) things out of \(n\) and order is unimportant and there can be no
    repetitions, then what we are describing is a \(k\)-subset of the
    \(n\)-set. There are \(C(n,k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\) distinct subsets.
    Here, we'll give an example that doesn't sound like we're talking
    about counting subsets of a particular size. (Although we really are!)
