          If \(n\) coins are flipped, the probability that all of them 
          are “heads” is \(1/2^n\).

          \hint{If \(1\) coin is flipped, the the probability that it is “heads” is \(1/2\). Or if we try it 
          when \(n=0\), ``If no coins are flipped the probability that all of them are heads is 1.  Does that
          make sense to you?  Is it reasonable that we would say it is 100% certain that all of the coins
          are heads in a set that doesn't contain <!--Style me with CSS--><em>any</em> coins? }
