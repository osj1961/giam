    The setup for Monge's circle theorem consists of three random circles
    drawn in the plane. Well, to be honest they can't be entirely random â€” we can't allow a circle that is entirely inside another circle. Because,
    if a circle was entirely inside another, there would be no external tangents
    and Monge's circle theorem is about external tangents.
