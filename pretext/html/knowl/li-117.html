        Rewrite the sentence “Fix the toilet or I won't pay the rent!” as
        a conditional.



        \hint{The way I see it there are eight possible ways to arrange "You fix the toilet" and "I'll pay the rent" (or their respective negations) around an implication arrow.
        Here they all are. You decide which one sounds best.

        If you fix the toilet, then I'll pay the rent.
        If you fix the toilet, then I won't pay the rent.
        If you don't fix the toilet, I'll pay the rent.
        If you don't fix the toilet, then I won't pay the rent.
        If I payed the rent, then you must have fixed the toilet.
        If I payed the rent, then you must not have fixed the toilet.
        If I didn't pay the rent, then you must have fixed the toilet.
        If I didn't pay the rent, then you must not have fixed the toilet.

        Some of those are truly strange…
