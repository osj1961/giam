    Oftentimes one can save considerable effort in an inductive
    proof by creatively using the factored form during intermediate steps.
    On the other hand, sometimes it is easier to just simplify everything
    completely, and also, completely simplify the expression on the
    right-hand side of \(P(k+1)\) and then verify that the two things are
    equal. This is basically just another take on the technique of
    “working backwards from the conclusion.” Just remember that
    in writing-up your proof you need to make it look as if you reasoned
    directly from the premises to the conclusion. We'll illustrate
    what we've been discussing in this paragraph while proving
    the formula for the sum of the squares of the first \(n\) positive integers.
