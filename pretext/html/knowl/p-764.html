    If a computer scientist were seeking a data structure to implement the
    notion of “set,” he'd want a sorted list where repetitions of an entry
    were somehow disallowed. We've already noted that a set should be thought of
    as an unordered collection, and yet it's been asserted that a <!--Style me with CSS--><em>sorted</em>
    list would be the right vehicle for representing a set on a computer. Why?
    One reason is that we'd like to be able to tell (quickly) whether two sets
    are the same or not. If the elements have been presorted it's easier.
