    Finally, we are ready to face a fundamental problem that was
    glossed-over in <a href="sec_basic.html" alt="Section 1.1 Basic sets" title="Section 1.1 Basic sets">SectionÂ 1.1</a>. We defined two sets
    back then, \(\Rationals\) and \(\Reals\), the hidden assumption that one
    makes in asserting that there are two of something is that the two
    things are distinct. Is this really the case? The reals have been
    defined (unrigorously) as numbers that measure the magnitudes of
    physical quantities, so another way to state the question is this:
    Are there physical quantities (for example lengths) that are <!--Style me with CSS--><em>not</em>
    rational numbers?
