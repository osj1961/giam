    Let us suppose that an arbitrary triangle \({\triangle}ABC\) is given.
    We want to show that the triangle whose vertices are the intersections
    of the adjacent trisectors is equilateral — this triangle will be
    referred to as the <!--Style me with CSS--><em>Morley triangle</em>.
    Let's also denote by
    \(A\), \(B\) and \(C\) the measures of the angles of \({\triangle}ABC\). (This
    is what is generally known as an “abuse of notation” — we are intentionally
    confounding the vertices (\(A\), \(B\) and \(C\)) of the triangle with the
    measure of the angles at those vertices.) It turns out that it is
    fairly hard to reason from our knowledge of what the angles \(A\), \(B\) and \(C\)
    are to deduce that the Morley triangle is equilateral. How does the
    following plan sound: suppose we construct a triangle, that definitely
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>does</em> have an equilateral Morley triangle, whose angles also happen
    to be \(A\), \(B\) and \(C\). Such a triangle would be
    
    similar<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-62" id="fn-62"><span class="footnote"><sup> 2 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-62" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">In Geometry, two objects are said to be <!--Style me with CSS--><em>similar</em> 
    if one can be made to exactly coincide with the other after a series of 
    rigid translations, rotations and scalings.  In other words, they have 
    the same shape if you allow for differences in scale and are allowed to 
    slide them around and spin them about as needed.</span></span>
    to the original
    triangle \({\triangle}ABC\) — if we follow the 
    similarity transform from the
    constructed triangle back to \({\triangle}ABC\) we will see that their
    Morley triangles must coincide; thus if one is equilateral so is the other!
