    There is one other subtle trick for devising statements to be
    proved by PMI that you should know about. An example should
    suffice to make it clear. Notice that \(7\) is equivalent to \(1 \pmod{6}\),
    it follows that any power of \(7\) is also \(1 \pmod{6}\). So, if we subtract
    \(1\) from some power of 7 we will have a number that is divisible by \(6\).
