    A couple of the examples in the exercise above actually have two quantifiers
    in them. When there are two or more (different) quantifiers in a sentence
    you have to be careful about keeping their order straight. The following
    two sentences contain all the same elements except that the words that
    indicate quantification have been switched. Do they have the same meaning?
