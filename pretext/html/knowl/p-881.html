    There is a certain “zen” to Venn diagrams that must be internalized,
    but once you have done so they can be used to think very effectively
    about the relationships between sets. The main deal is that the points
    inside of one of the simple closed curves are not necessarily in the set — only <!--Style me with CSS--><em>some</em> of the points inside a simple closed curve are in the
    set, and we don't know precisely where they are! The various simple closed
    curves in a Venn diagram divide the universe up into a bunch of regions.
    It might be best to think of these regions as fenced-in areas in which
    the elements of a set mill about, much like domesticated animals
    in their pens.
    One of our main tools in working with Venn diagrams is to deduce that
    certain of these regions don't contain any elements — we then mark that
    region with the emptyset symbol (\(\emptyset\)).
