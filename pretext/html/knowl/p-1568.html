    Point one is actually pretty valid. Physicists have determined that we
    appear to inhabit a universe of finite scope, containing a finite number of
    subatomic particles, so in reality there can be no infinite sets. Nevertheless,
    the axioms we use to study many fields in mathematics guarantee that the
    objects of consideration are indeed infinite in number. Infinity appears as a
    concept even when we know it can't appear in actuality.
    Point two, the “there's only one size of infinity” argument is wrong. We'll
    see an informal argument showing that there are at least two sizes of infinity,
    and a more formal theorem that shows there is actually an infinite hierarchy
    of infinities in <a href="sec_cantors_thm.html" alt="Section 8.3 Cantor's theorem" title="Section 8.3 Cantor's theorem">Section 8.3</a>
