    There is a slightly silly tendency these days to define functions as being
    a special class of relations. (This is slightly silly not because it's wrong — indeed, functions are a special type of relation — but because it's the
    least intuitive approach possible, and it is usually foisted-off on middle or
    high school students.) When this approach is taken, we first define
    a relation to be <!--Style me with CSS--><em>any</em> set of ordered pairs and then state a
    restriction on the ordered pairs that may be in a relation if it
    is to be a function. Clearly what these Algebra textbook authors
    are talking about are <!--Style me with CSS--><em>binary</em> relations, a ternary relation
    would actually be a set of ordered triples, and higher order relations
    might involve ordered 4-tuples or 5-tuples, etc. A couple of small examples
    should help to clear up this connection between a relation symbol and
    some set of tuples.
