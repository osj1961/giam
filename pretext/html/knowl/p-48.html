    You probably first heard this definition in Middle School, if not
    earlier. It is a perfectly valid definition of what it means
    for an integer to be prime. In more advanced mathematics, it
    was found that it was necessary to define a notion of primality
    for objects other than integers. It turns out that the following
    statement is essentially equivalent to the definition of “prime” we've just
    given (when dealing with integers), but that it can be applied in
    more general settings.
