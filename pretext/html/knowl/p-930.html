  The simplest argument in favor of the validity of PMI is simply that it is
  axiomatic. This may seem somewhat unsatisfying, but the axioms for
  the natural number system, known as the Peano axioms,
  include one that justifies PMI. The Peano axioms will not be treated
  thoroughly in this book, but here they are:

  <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li id="li-351"><p id="p-931">
        There is a least element of \(\Naturals\) that we denote by \(0\).
      </p></li>
<li id="li-352"><p id="p-932">
        Every natural number \(a\) has a successor denoted by \(s(a)\).
        (Intuitively, think of \(s(a) = a+1\).)
      </p></li>
<li id="li-353"><p id="p-933">
        There is no natural number whose successor is \(0\).  (In other
        words, -1 isn't in \(\Naturals\).)
      </p></li>
<li id="li-354"><p id="p-934">
        Distinct natural numbers have distinct successors.  
        (\(a \neq b \; \implies \; s(a) \neq s(b)\))
      </p></li>
<li id="li-355"><p id="p-935">
        If a subset of the natural numbers contains \(0\) and also has the
        property that whenever \(a \in S\) it follows that \(s(a) \in S\), then the
        subset \(S\) is actually equal to \(\Naturals\).
      </p></li>
</ol>
