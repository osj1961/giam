    When two transistors are connected in parallel (this is illustrated in
    <span>&lt;&lt;Unresolved xref, reference "fig_par"; check spelling or use "provisional" attribute&gt;&gt;</span>) current can flow from x to y when either (or <!--Style me with CSS--><em>both</em>)
    of the wires at z and w have voltage applied. This brings up a point
    which is confusing for some: in common speech the use of the word “or” often
    has the sense known as <!--Style me with CSS--><em>exclusive or</em> (a.k.a. xor), when we say “X or Y”
    we mean “Either X or Y, but not both.” In Electronics and Mathematics,
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>or</em> always has the non-exclusive (better known as
    inclusive) sense.
