    It may seem at first that this blank-comma thing is okay, but that we're
    still no closer to answering the question we started with. It may seem
    that way until you realize how easy it is to count these blank-comma
    arrangements! You see, there are 10 symbols in one of these blank-comma
    arrangements
    and if we choose positions for (say) the commas, the blanks will have to go
    into the other positions â€” thus every 5-subset of \(\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\}\)
    gives us a blank-comma arrangement and every one of <!--Style me with CSS--><em>them</em> gives us
    a Yahtzee outcome. That is why there are \(C(10, 5) = 252\) outcomes
    listed in the giant tabulation above.
