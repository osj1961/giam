    A systematic method for accomplishing such a design task involves
    a notion called <!--Style me with CSS--><em>disjunctive normal form</em>.
    A Boolean expression
    is in disjunctive normal form if it consists of the disjunction of
    one or more statements, each of which consists entirely of conjunctions
    of predicate variables and/or their negations. In other words, the <!--Style me with CSS--><em>or</em>
    of a bunch of <!--Style me with CSS--><em>ands</em>. In terms of digital logic circuits, the <!--Style me with CSS--><em>and</em>s
    we're talking about are called <!--Style me with CSS--><em>recognizers</em>.
    For example,
    the following 3-input and-gates recognize the input states in
    the 4th, 7th and 8th rows of the i/o table above. (These are the rows
    where the output is supposed to be 1.)
