    The real numbers have a natural ordering, and hence, so do the
    other sets that are contained in \(\Reals\). The complex numbers
    can't really be put into a well-defined order â€” which should be
    bigger, \(1\) or \(i\)? But we do have a way to, at least partially,
    accomplish this task. The 
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>modulus</em> of a complex number is a real number that gives the
    distance from the origin (\(0+0i\)) of the complex plane, to a given
    complex number. We indicate the modulus using absolute value bars,
    and you should note that if a complex number happens to be purely
    real, the modulus and the usual notion of absolute value coincide.
    If \(z = a + bi\) is a complex number, then its modulus, \(\|a + bi \|\),
    is given by the formula \(\sqrt{a^2+b^2}\).
