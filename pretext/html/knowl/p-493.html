    Finally, deductions — I should note that the conclusion is also a
    deduction — obey a very strict rule: every deduction follows from
    the premises that have already been written down (this includes
    axioms and definitions that probably won't actually have been written,
    hypotheses and all the deductions made up to this point) by one of the
    so-called rules of inference.
