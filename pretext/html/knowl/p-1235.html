    A function that is both injective and surjective (one-to-one and onto)
    is known as a <!--Style me with CSS--><em>bijection</em>. Bijections are tremendously
    important in mathematics since they provide a way of perfectly matching
    up the elements of two sets. You will probably spend a good bit of time
    in the future devising maps between sets and then proving that they are
    bijections, so we will start practicing that skill nowâ€¦
