    A diagram such as we have given in <span>&lt;&lt;Unresolved xref, reference "fig_rel1"; check spelling or use "provisional" attribute&gt;&gt;</span> seems like a
    very natural thing. Such pictures certainly give us an easy visual
    tool for thinking
    about relations. But we should point out certain hidden assumptions.
    First, they'll only work if we are dealing with finite sets, or sets
    like the odd numbers in our example (sets that are infinite but could
    in principle be listed). Second, by drawing the two sets separately,
    it seems that we are assuming they are not only different, but
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>disjoint</em>. The sets not only need not be disjoint, but often
    (most of the time!) we have relations that go from a set to itself
    so the sets in a picture like this may be identical. In <span>&lt;&lt;Unresolved xref, reference "fig_rel2"; check spelling or use "provisional" attribute&gt;&gt;</span>
    we illustrate the divisibility relation on the set of all divisors of
    6 — this is an example in which the sets on either side of the relation
    are the same. Notice the linguistic distinction, we can talk about
    either “a relation from \(A\) to \(B\)” (when there are really two
    different sets) or “a relation on \(A\)” (when there is only one).
