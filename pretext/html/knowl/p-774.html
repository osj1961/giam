    One last thing before we end this section. The size (a.k.a. cardinality) of a set is just the number of elements in it. We use the
    very same symbol for cardinality as we do for the absolute value of a
    numerical entity. There should really never be any confusion. If \(A\) is
    a set then \(|A|\) means that we should count how many things are in \(A\).
    If \(A\) isn't a set then we are talking about the ordinary absolute value
