    Suppose that the rules of the game for PMI were changed so that one
    did the following:

    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li id="li-367"><p id="p-971">
          Basis.  Prove that \(P(0)\) is true.
        </p></li>
<li id="li-368"><p id="p-972">
          Inductive step.  Prove that for all \(k\), \(P_k\) implies \(P_{k+2}\)
        </p></li>
</ul>
    </p>

    Explain why this would not constitute a valid proof that \(P_n\) holds 
    for all natural numbers \(n\). 
     How could we change the basis in this outline to obtain a valid proof?

    \hint{In this modified version, \(P(0)\) is not going to imply \(P(1)\). and in fact, none of the odd numbered
    statements will be proven.  If we change the 
    basis so that we prove both \(P(0)\) and \(P(1)\), all the even statements will be implied by
    \(P(0)\) being true and all the odd statements get forced because \(P(1)\) is true.}</article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_induct.html#li-366">in-context</a></span>
