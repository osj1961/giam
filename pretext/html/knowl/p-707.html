          Prove that if \(n\) is an odd number then \(n^4 \pmod{16} = 1\).

          \hint{

          While one could perform fairly complicated arithmetic, expanding expression like
          \((16k+13)^4\) and then regrouping to put it in the form \(16q+1\) (and one would need 
          to do that work for each of the odd remainders modulo \(16\)),  that would be missing out
          on the true power of modular notation.  In a “\(\pmod{16}\)” calculation one can simply ignore
          summands like \(16k\) because they are \(0 \pmod{16}\).  Thus, for example,
          \begin{equation*}
            (16k+7)^4 \pmod{16} \; = \; 7^4 \pmod{16} \; = \; 2401 \pmod{16}  \; = \; 1.
          \end{equation*}
          So, essentially one just needs to compute the \(4\)th powers of \(1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13\)  and \(15\), and
          then reduce them modulo 16.  An even greater economy is possible if one notes that (modulo 16) many
          of those cases are negatives of one another — so their \(4\)th powers are equal.
          }
