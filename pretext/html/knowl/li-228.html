        Don't say “if” when you mean “since.”  Really!  If you start a
        proof about rational numbers like so:
        <blockquote>
<!--Style me with CSS--><em>Proof:</em> Suppose that \(x\) is a particular but arbitrary rational number.
        If \(x\) is a rational number, it follows that \ldots
        </blockquote>
        people are going to look at you funny.  What's the point of 
        <!--Style me with CSS--><em>supposing</em>
        that \(x\) is rational, then acting as if you're in doubt of that fact by
        writing “if”?   You mean “since.”
