    The answer is that <!--Style me with CSS--><em>yes</em> there are numbers that measure lengths
    which are not rational numbers. With our new and improved definition
    of what is meant by a rational number we are ready to <!--Style me with CSS--><em>prove</em> that
    there is at least one length that can't be expressed as a fraction.
    Using the Pythagorean theorem it's easy to see that the length of the
    diagonal of a unit square is \(\sqrt{\,2}\). The proof that \(\sqrt{\,2}\) is
    not rational is usually attributed to the followers of Pythagoras (but
    probably not to Pythagoras himself). In any case it is a result of
    great antiquity. The proof is of a type known as
     <!--Style me with CSS--><em>reductio ad absurdum</em>
    <span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-8" id="fn-8"><span class="footnote"><sup> 1 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-8" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">Reduction to an absurdity — better known these 
    days as proof by contradiction. </span></span>. We show that a given assumption
    leads logically to an absurdity, a statement that <!--Style me with CSS--><em>can't</em> be true,
    then we know that the original assumption must itself be false. This
    method of proof is a bit slippery; one has to first assume the
    <!--Style me with CSS--><em>exact opposite</em> of what one hopes to prove and then argue (on
    purpose) towards a ridiculous conclusion.
