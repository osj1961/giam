    If-then control statements are decision makers. They first calculate
    a Boolean expression (this is just a fancy way of saying something
    that is either <tt class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">true</tt> or <tt class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">false</tt>), and send program flow to
    different locations depending on that result. A small example will
    serve as an illustration. Suppose that in the body of an algorithm we
    wish to check if 2 variables, \(x\) and \(y\) are equal, and if they are,
    increment \(x\) by 1. This is illustrated in <a knowl="./knowl/fig_if-then.html" knowl-id="xref-fig_if-then" alt="Table 1.5.1 " title="Table 1.5.1 ">FigureÂ 1.5.1</a>
    both in pseudocode and as a flowchart.
