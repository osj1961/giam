    Euler settled the question (it can't be done) be converting the map of
    Königsberg into a graph and then making some simple observations about
    the parities of the nodes in this graph. The  degree of a node
    in a graph is the number of edges that are incident with it (if a so-called
    “loop edge” is present it adds two to the node's degree). The “parity
    of a node” is shorthand for the “parity of the <!--Style me with CSS--><em>degree</em> of the node.”
