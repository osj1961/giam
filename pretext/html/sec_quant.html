    All of the statements discussed in the previous sections were of the
    “completely unambiguous” sort; that is, they didn't have any <!--Style me with CSS--><em>unknowns</em>
    in them. As a reader of this text, it's a sure bet that you've mastered
    Algebra and are firmly convinced of the utility of \(x\) and \(y\). Admittedly,
    we've used variables to refer to sentences (or sentence fragments) themselves,
    but we've said that sentences that had variables <!--Style me with CSS--><em>in them</em> were ambiguous
    and didn't even deserve to be called logical statements. The notion
    of <!--Style me with CSS--><em>quantification</em>
    allows us to use the power of variables within a
    sentence without introducing ambiguity.
  </p>
<p id="p-435">
    Consider the sentence “There are exactly 7 odd primes less than 20.”
    This sentence has some kind of ambiguity in it (because it doesn't mention
    the primes explicitly) and yet it certainly seems to have a definite
    truth value! The reason its truth value is known (by the way, it is T)
    is that the sentence is quantified. “X is an odd prime less than 20.”
    is an ambiguous sentence, but “There are exactly 7 distinct X's that
    are odd primes less than 20.” is not. This example represents a fairly
    unusual form of quantification. Usually, we take away the ambiguity
    of a sentence having a variable in it by asserting one of two levels
    of quantification: “this is true at least once” or “this is always true”.
    We've actually seen the symbols (\(\exists\) and \(\forall\)) for these
    concepts already (in <a href="sec_scary.html" alt="Section 1.3 More scary notation" title="Section 1.3 More scary notation">Section 1.3</a>).
  </p>
<p id="p-436">
    An <!--Style me with CSS--><em>open sentence</em>
    is one that has variables in it. We represent
    open sentences using a sort of functional notation to show what
    variables are in them.
  </p>
<p id="p-437">
  Examples:

  </p>
<ol id="ol-27" style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li id="li-164"><p id="p-438">
        \(P(x)\) = “\(2^{2^x}+1\) is a prime.”
      </p></li>
<li id="li-165"><p id="p-439">
        \(Q(x,y)\) = “\(x\) is prime or \(y\) is a divisor of \(x\).”
      </p></li>
<li id="li-166"><p id="p-440">
        \(L(f,c,l)\) = “The function \(f\) has limit \(l\) at \(c\), if 
        and only if, 
        for every positive number \(\epsilon\), there is a positive number \(\delta\) 
        such that whenever \(|x-c| \lt  \delta\) it follows that \(|f(x)-l| \lt  \epsilon\).”
      </p></li>
</ol>
<p>
  </p>
<p id="p-441">
    That last example certainly is a doozey! At first glance it would appear
    to have more than three variables in it, and indeed it does! In order of
    appearance, we have \(f\), \(l\), \(c\), \(\epsilon\), \(\delta\) and \(x\) — the
    last three variables that appear (\(\epsilon\), \(\delta\) and \(x\)) are said
    to be <!--Style me with CSS--><em>bound</em>.
    A variable in an open sentence is bound if it is in the
    scope of a quantifier. Bound variables don't need to be mentioned
    in the argument list of the sentence. Unfortunately, when sentences are
    given in natural languages the quantification status of a variable may
    not be clear. For example in the third sentence above, the variable \(\delta\)
    is easily seen to be in the scope of the quantifier \(\exists\) because of the
    words “there is a positive number” that precede it. Similarly, \(\epsilon\)
    is universally quantified (\(\forall\)) because the phrase “for every positive
    number” appears before it. What is the status of \(x\)? Is it really bound?
    The answers to such questions may not be clear at first, but after some
    thought you should be able to decide that \(x\) is universally quantified.

        What word in example iii) indicates that \(x\) is in the
        scope of a \(\forall\) quantifier?
      </p></article><p id="p-443">
    It is not uncommon, in advanced Mathematics, to encounter compound sentences
    involving dozens of variables and 4 or 5 levels of quantification. Such
    sentences seem hopelessly complicated at first sight — the key to
    understanding them is to determine each variable's quantification status
    explicitly and to break things down into simpler sub-parts.
  </p>
<p id="p-444">
    For instance, in understanding example iii) above, it might be
    useful to define some new open sentences:
  </p>
<p id="p-445">
    \(D(x,c,\delta)\) = “\(|x-c| \lt  \delta\)”
  </p>
<p id="p-446">
    \(E(f,x,l,\epsilon)\) = “\(|f(x)-l| \lt  \epsilon\)”
  </p>
<p id="p-447">
    Furthermore, it's often handy to replace an awkward phrase (such as
    “the limit of \(f\) at \(c\) is \(l\)”) with symbols when possible.
  </p>
<p id="p-448">
    Example iii) now looks like
    \begin{equation*}
      \lim_{x\rightarrow c}f(x) = l \iff \forall \epsilon&gt;0 \, \exists \delta&gt;0 \, \forall x \, D(x,c,\delta) \implies E(f,x,l,\epsilon).
    \end{equation*}
  </p>
<p id="p-449">
    The sentence \(D(x,c,\delta)\) is usually interpreted as saying that
    “\(x\) is close to \(c\)” (where \(\delta\) tells you <!--Style me with CSS--><em>how</em> close.)
    The sentence \(E(f,x,l,\epsilon)\) could be expressed informally as
    “\(f(x)\) is close to \(l\)” (again, \(\epsilon\) serves to make the
    word “close” more exact).
  </p>
<p id="p-450">
    It's instructive to write this sentence one last time, <!--Style me with CSS--><em>completely</em>
    in symbols and without the abbreviations we created for saying
    that \(x\) is near \(c\) and \(f(x)\) is near \(l\):
  </p>
<p id="p-451">
    \(\displaystyle \lim_{x\rightarrow c}f(x) = l \iff \forall \epsilon&gt;0 \, \exists 
    \delta&gt;0 \, \forall x \, (|x-c| \lt  \delta) \implies (|f(x)-l| \lt  \epsilon)\).
  </p>
<p id="p-452">
    It would not be unfair to say that developing the facility to read,
    and understand, this hieroglyph (and others like it) constitutes the
    first several weeks of a course in Real Analysis.
  </p>
<p id="p-453">
    Let us turn back to another of the examples (of an open sentence) from the
    beginning of this section. \(P(x)\) = “\(2^{2^x}+1\) is a prime.”
  </p>
<p id="p-454">
    In the 17th century, Pierre de Fermat
    made the conjecture<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-15" id="fn-15"><span class="footnote"><sup> 1 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-15" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">Fermat's 
    more famous conjecture, that \(x^n+y^n=z^n\) has no non-trivial integer solutions
    if \(n\) is an integer with \(n&gt;2\) was discovered after his death.</span></span> that
    \(\forall x \in {\mathbb N}, P(x)\). No doubt, this seemed reasonable to Fermat
    because the numbers given by this formula (they are called
    Fermat numbers in
    his honor) are all primes — at first! Fermat numbers are conventionally
    denoted with a subscripted letter F, \(F_n = 2^{2^n}+1\), the first five
    Fermat numbers are prime.
  </p>\(\displaystyle F_0 = 2^{2^0}+1 = 3\)\(\displaystyle F_1 = 2^{2^1}+1 = 5\)\(\displaystyle F_2 = 2^{2^2}+1 = 17\)\(\displaystyle F_3 = 2^{2^3}+1 = 257\)\(\displaystyle F_4 = 2^{2^4}+1 = 65537\)<p id="p-455">
    Fermat probably computed that \(F_5=4294967297\), and we can well imagine
    that he checked that this number was not divisible by any small primes.
    Of course, this was well before the development of effective computing
    machinery, so we shouldn't blame Fermat for not noticing that
    \(4294967297 = 641 \cdot 6700417\). This remarkable feat of factoring
    can be replicated in seconds on a modern computer, however it was done
    first by  Leonhard Euler in 1732!
    There is quite a lot of literature
    concerning the primeness and/or compositeness of Fermat numbers. So
    far, all the Fermat numbers between \(F_5\) and \(F_{32}\) (inclusive) have
    been shown to be composite. One might be tempted to conjecture that
    only the first five Fermat numbers are prime, however this temptation
    should be resisted …
  </p>
<p id="p-456">
    Let us set aside, for the moment, further questions about Fermat numbers.
    Suppose we define the set \(U\) (for `Universe') by \(U=\{0,1,2,3,4\}\).
    Then the assertion, “\(\forall x \in U, P(x)\).” is certainly true.
    You should note that the only variable in this sentence is \(x\), and
    that the variable is bound — it is universally quantified. Open sentences
    that have all variables bound are <!--Style me with CSS--><em>statements</em>. It is possible
    (in principle, and in finite universes, in practice) to check the
    truth value of such sentences.
    Indeed, the sentence “\(\forall x \in U, P(x)\)” has the same logical content
    as “\(P(0) \land P(1) \land P(2) \land P(3)  \land P(4)\)”. Both happen to be
    true, but the real point here is to note that a universally quantified sentence
    can be thought of instead as a conjunction.
  </p>
<article class="exercise-like" id="exercise-23"><h5 class="heading">

        Define a new set \(U\) by \(U=\{0,1,2,3,4,5\}\).
        Write a sentence using disjunctions
        that is equivalent to “\(\exists x \in U, {\lnot}P(x)\).”
      </p></article><p id="p-458">
    Even when we are dealing with infinite universes, it is possible to
    think of universally quantified sentences in terms of conjunctions,
    and existentially quantified sentences in terms of disjunctions. For
    example, a quick look at the graphs should be sufficient to convince you
    that “\(x &gt; \ln x\)” is a sentence that is true for all \(x\) values in
    \({\mathbb R}^+\). There is a notation, reminiscent of so-called sigma notation
    for sums, that can be used to express this universally quantified sentence as
    a conjunction.
    \begin{equation*}
      \forall x \in {\mathbb R}^+, x &gt; \ln x \; \cong \; 
      \bigwedge_{x \in {\mathbb R}^+} x &gt; \ln x
    \end{equation*}
  </p>
<p id="p-459">
    A similar notation exists for disjunctions. Purely as an example, consider
    the following problem from recreational math: Find a four digit number that
    is an integer multiple of its reversal. (By reversal, we mean the four
    digit number with the digits in the opposite order — for example, the
    reversal of 1234 is 4321.)

    An important, or at least useful, talent for a Mathematics student to develop
    is the ability to negate quantified sentences. There are two major reasons for this:
    the techniques known as proof by contradiction and proof by contraposition.
    The contrapositive of a conditional sentence is logically
    equivalent to it. Many veteran proofwriters give newcomers the advice:
  </p>
<p id="p-463">
    “If you get stuck, try writing down the contrapositive.”
  </p>
<p id="p-464">
    Writing down the contrapositive of a logical statement will often involve finding the
    negation of a quantified sentence. Proof by contradiction also requires you to be able to
    negate a logical statement in order to even get started. Let's try a one.
  </p>
<p id="p-465">
    Our universe of discourse<span class="hidden-knowl-wrapper"><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-17" id="fn-17"><span class="footnote"><sup> 3 </sup></span></a></span><span id="hk-fn-17" style="display: none;" class="tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote">The Pep Boys — Manny, Moe and 
    Jack — are hopefully known to some readers as the mascots of a chain 
    of automotive supply stores.</span></span>
    will be \(P = \{ \mbox{Manny} , \mbox{Moe} , \mbox{Jack}  \}\).
    Consider the sentence
    “\(\forall x \in P, x\; \mbox{starts with M}\).” The equivalent sentence
    expressed conjunctively is
    \begin{gather*}
(\mbox{Manny starts with M} ) \land\\
(\mbox{Moe starts with M} ) \land\\
(\mbox{Jack starts with M} ).
\end{gather*}
  </p>
<p id="p-466">
    The negation
    of this sentence (by DeMorgan's law) is a disjunction:
    \begin{gather*}
(\mbox{Manny doesn't start with M} ) \lor\\
(\mbox{Moe doesn't start with M} ) \lor\\
(\mbox{Jack doesn't start with M} )
\end{gather*}
  </p>
<p id="p-467">
    Finally, this disjunction of three sentences can be converted into
    a single sentence, existentially quantified over \(P\):
  </p>
<p id="p-468">
    “\(\exists x \in P, {\lnot}(x \, \mbox{starts with M} )\).”
  </p>
<p id="p-469">
    The discussion in the previous paragraphs justifies some laws of
    Logic which should be thought of as generalizations of DeMorgan's laws:
    \begin{equation*}
      {\lnot}( \forall x \in U, P(x)) \; \cong \; \exists x \in U, {\lnot}P(x)
    \end{equation*}
    and
    \begin{equation*}
      {\lnot}( \exists x \in U, P(x)) \; \cong \; \forall x \in U, {\lnot}P(x).
    \end{equation*}
  </p>
<p id="p-470">
    It's equally valid to think of these rules in a way that's divorced from
    DeMorgan's laws. To show that a universal sentence is <!--Style me with CSS--><em>false</em>, it suffices
    to show that an existential sentence involving a negation of the original is
    true.
  </p>
<p id="p-471">
    If someone announces that “All the Pep boys name's start with M!” you might counter that
    with “Uhhmmm… What about Jack?”
  </p>
<p id="p-472">
    In other words, to show that it is not the case that every Pep boy's name starts
    with `M', one only needs to demonstrate that there is a Pep boy (Jack) whose
    name doesn't start with `M'.

        There is a common variant of the existential quantifier,
        \(\exists !\), if you write \(\exists ! \, x, \, P(x)\) you are asserting 
        that there is a <!--Style me with CSS--><em>unique</em> element 
        in the universe that makes \(P(x)\) true.
        Determine how to negate the sentence \(\exists ! \, x, \, P(x)\).



        \hint{
        Unique existence is essentially saying that there is exactly 1 element of the universe of discourse that makes P(x) true. The negation of "there is exactly 1" is "there's either none, or at least 2".

        Is that enough of a hint?

        This is asking you to put a couple of things together. The first thing is that in negating a quantified statement, we get a new statement with all the quantified variables occurring in the same order but with \(\forall\)'s and \(\exists\)'s interchanged. The second issue is that the logical statement that appears after all the quantifiers needs to be negated. Since, in this statement we have a conditional, you must remember to negate that properly (its negation is a conjunction).

        \(\displaystyle \exists \epsilon&gt;0 \, \forall 
        \delta&gt;0 \, \exists x \, (|x-c| \lt  \delta)  \land  (|f(x)-l| \geq \epsilon)\).
