      {Counting} Many results in mathematics are answers to <q>How many <ellipsis /></q> questions.
    </p>

    <p>
      <q>How many subsets does a finite set have?</q>
    </p>

    <p>
      <q>How many handshakes will transpire when <m>n</m> people first meet?</q>
    </p>

    <p>
      <q>How many functions are there from a set of size <m>n</m> to a set of size <m>m</m>?</q>
    </p>

    <p>
      The title of this section, <q>Counting,</q> is not intended to evoke the usual
      process of counting sheep, or counting change. What we want is to be able
      to count some collection <em>in principle</em> so that we will be able to
      discover a formula for its size.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are two principles that will be indispensable in counting things.
      These principles are simple, yet powerful, and they have been named in
      the most unimaginative way possible. The <q>multiplication rule</q> which
      tells us when we should multiply, and the <q>addition rule</q> which tells
      us when we should add.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before we describe these principles in detail,
      we'll have a look at a simpler problem which is most easily described
      by an example: How many integers are there in the list <m>(7,8,9,\ldots 44)</m>?
      We could certainly write down all the integers from <m>7</m> to <m>44</m> (inclusive)
      and then count them <mdash /> although this wouldn't be the best plan if the numbers
      <m>7</m> and <m>44</m> were replaced with (say) <m>7,045,356</m> and <m>22,355,201</m>. A method
      that does lead to a generalized ability to count the elements of a finite
      sequence arises if we think carefully about what exactly a finite sequence
      <em>is</em>.
    </p>

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <index><main>sequence</main></index><term>sequence from a set <m>S</m></term> is a function from
          <m>\Naturals</m> to <m>S</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <index><main>finite sequence</main></index><term>finite sequence from a set <m>S</m></term> is a
          function from <m>\{0, 1, 2, \ldots , n\}</m> to <m>S</m>, where <m>n</m> is some
          particular (finite) integer.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      Now it is easy to see that there are <m>n+1</m> elements in the set
      <m>\{0, 1, 2, \ldots , n \}</m> so counting the elements of a finite
      sequence will be easy if we can determine the function involved
      and figure out what <m>n</m> is by inverting it (<m>n</m> is an inverse image
      for the last element in a listing of the sequence).
    </p>

    <p>
      In the example that we started with, the function is <m>f(x)=x+7</m>. We
      can sum up the process that allows us to count the sequence by saying
      ``there is a one-to-one correspondence between the lists
      <me>
        (7, 8, 9, \ldots , 44 )
      </me>
      and
      <me>
        (0, 1, 2, \ldots , 37 )
      </me>
      and the later has <m>38</m> entries.''
    </p>

    <p>
      More generally, if there is a list of consecutive numbers beginning
      with <m>k</m> and ending with <m>n</m>, there will be <m>n-k+1</m> entries in the
      list. Lists of consecutive integers represent a relatively simple
      type of finite sequence. Usually we would have some slightly more
      interesting function that we'd need to invert.
    </p>

    <p>
      The following exercise involves inverting the function <m>(x+5)^2</m>.
    </p>
    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          How many integers are in the list <m>(25, 36, 49, \ldots , 10000)</m> ?
        </p>
      </statement>
    </exercise>
    <p>
      We will have a lot more practice with counting the elements of sequences
      in the exercises at the end of this section, let's continue on our
      tour of counting by having a look at the addition rule.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <index><main>addition rule</main></index>addition rule says that it is appropriate to add if we can
      partition a collection into <em>disjoint</em> pieces. In other words,
      if a set <m>S</m> is the union of two or more subsets and these subsets
      are mutually disjoint, we can find the size of <m>S</m> by adding the sizes
      of the subsets.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the game <index><main>Yahtzee</main></index>Yahtzee, one rolls 5 dice and (optionally) performs a
      second roll of some or all of the dice. The object is to achieve
      several final configurations that are modeled after the hands in
      Poker. In particular, one configuration, known as a <q>full house,</q>
      is achieved by having two of one number and three of another.
      (Colloquially, we say <q>three-of-a-kind plus a pair is a full house.</q>)
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, we could use Yahtzee <q>hands</q> to provide us with a whole collection
      of counting problems once we have our basic counting principles,
      but for the moment we just want to make a simple (and obvious) point
      about <q>full houses</q> <mdash /> the pair is either smaller or larger than
      the three-of-a-kind. This means we can partition the set of all possible
      full houses into two disjoint sets <mdash /> the full houses consisting of a small
      pair and a larger three-of-a-kind and those where the pair is larger
      than the three-of-a-kind. If we can find some way of counting these
      two cases separately, then the total number of full houses will be the
      sum of these numbers.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="fig_full_house" >
      <caption>In Yahtzee, a full house may consist of 
      a pair and a larger three-of-a-kind, or vice versa.</caption>

    <p>
      The <index><main>multiplication rule</main></index>multiplication rule gives
      us a way of counting things by thinking
      about how we might construct them. The numbers that are multiplied
      are the number of choices we have in the construction process.
      Surprisingly often, the number of choices we can make in a given
      stage of constructing some configuration is independent of the choices
      that have gone before <mdash /> if this is not the case the multiplication rule
      may not apply.
    </p>

    <p>
      If some object can be constructed in <m>k</m> stages, and if in the first
      stage we have <m>n_1</m> choices as to how to proceed, in the second stage
      we have <m>n_2</m> choices, <em>et cetera</em>. Then the total number of such
      objects is the product <m>n_1n_2 \cdots n_k</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      A <index><main>permutation</main></index><em>permutation of an <m>n</m>-set</em> (w.l.o.g. <m>\{1,2,\ldots , n\}</m>) is an ordered <m>n</m>-tuple where each entry is a distinct element of the
      <m>n</m>-set. Generally, a permutation may be regarded as a bijection from
      an <m>n</m>-set to itself. Our first use of the multiplication rule will
      be to count the total number of permutations of <m>\{1, 2, 3, \ldots ,n\}</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's start by counting the permutations of <m>\{1, 2, 3\}</m>.
      A permutation will be a 3-tuple containing the numbers <m>1</m>, <m>2</m> and
      <m>3</m> in some order. We will think about building such a thing in
      three stages. First,
      we must select a number to go in the first position <mdash /> there are <m>3</m> choices.
      Having made that choice, there will only be two possibilities for the number
      in the second position. Finally there is just one number remaining to put in
      the third position<fn>People may say you have <q>no choice</q> in this 
      last situation, but what they mean is that you have only one choice.</fn>.
      Thus there are <m>3\cdot 2\cdot 1 = 6</m> permutations of a <m>3</m> element set.
    </p>

    <p>
      The general rule is that there are <m>n!</m> permutations of <m>\{1, 2, \ldots , n\}</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are times when configurations that are like permutations (in that they
      are ordered and have no duplicates) but don't consist of all <m>n</m> numbers
      are useful.
    </p>

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term><m>k</m>-permutation from an <m>n</m>-set</term> is an ordered selection
          of <m>k</m> distinct elements from a set of size <m>n</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      There are certain natural limitations on the value of <m>k</m>, for instance <m>k</m>
      can't be negative <mdash /> although (arguably) <m>k</m> can be 0, it makes more sense
      to think of <m>k</m> being at least 1. Also, if <m>k</m> exceeds
      <m>n</m> we won't be able to find <em>any</em> <m>k</m>-permutations,
      since it will be impossible
      to meet the <q>distinct</q> requirement. If <m>k</m> and <m>n</m> are equal, there is
      no difference between a <m>k</m>-permutation and an ordinary permutation.
      Therefore, we ordinarily restrict <m>k</m> to lie in the range <m>0 \lt  k \lt  n</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The notation <m>P(n,k)</m> is used for the total number of <m>k</m>-permutations
      of a set of size <m>n</m>. For example, <m>P(4,2)</m> is 12, since there are
      twelve different ordered pairs having distinct entries where the
      entries come from <m>\{1,2,3,4\}</m>.
    </p>
    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Write down all twelve <m>2</m>-permutations of the <m>4</m>-set <m>\{1,2,3,4\}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </exercise>
    <p>
      Counting <m>k</m>-permutations using the multiplication rule is easy. We
      build a <m>k</m>-permutation in <m>k</m> stages. In stage 1, we pick the first
      element in the permutation <mdash /> there are <m>n</m> possible choices. In
      stage 2, we pick the second element <mdash /> there are now only <m>n-1</m> choices
      since we may not repeat the first entry. We keep going like this until
      we've picked <m>k</m> entries. The number <m>P(n,k)</m> is the product of <m>k</m>
      numbers beginning with <m>n</m> and descending down to <m>n-k+1</m>. To verify
      that <m>n-k+1</m> is really the right lower limit, check that there are indeed
      <m>k</m> entries in the sequence
      <me>
        (n, n-1, n-2, \ldots n-k+1).
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      This verification may be easier if we rewrite the sequence as
      <me>
        (n-0, n-1, n-2, \ldots n-(k-1) ).
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's have a look at another small example <mdash /> <m>P(8,4)</m>. There will be 8
      choices for the first entry in a 4-tuple, 7 choices for the second
      entry, 6 choices for the third entry and 5 choices for the last entry.
      (Note that <m>5 = 8-4+1</m>.) Thus <m>P(8,4)=8\cdot 7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 = 1680</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, we should take note that it is relatively easy to express <m>P(n,k)</m>
      using factorials. If we divide a number factorialized by some smaller
      number factorialized, we will get a descending product just like those above.
    </p>
    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          What factorial would we divide <m>8!</m> by in order to get <m>P(8,4)</m>?
        </p>
      </statement>
    </exercise>
    <p>
      The general rule is that <m>P(n,k) = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      If we were playing a card game in which we were dealt 5 cards from
      a deck of 52, we would receive our cards in the form of
      <m>P(52,5) = 52 \cdot 51 \cdot 50 \cdot 49 \cdot 48 = 311875200</m> ordered
      <m>5</m>-tuples. Normally, we don't really care about what order the cards
      came to us in. In a card game one ordinarily begins sorting the cards
      so as to see what hand one has <mdash /> this is a sure sign that the order the
      cards were dealt is actually immaterial. How many different orders can
      five cards be put in? The answer to this question is <m>5! = 120</m> since
      what we are discussing is nothing more than a permutation of a set of
      size 5. Thus, if we say that there are 311,875,200 different possible
      hands in 5-card poker, we are over-counting things by quite a bit! Any
      given hand will appear 120 times in that tabulation, which means the
      right value is <m>311875200/120 = 2598960</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Okay, so there around 2.6 million
      different hands in 5-card poker. Unless you plan to become a gambler
      this isn't really that useful of a piece of information <mdash /> but if you
      generalize what we've done in the paragraph above, you'll have found
      a way to count unordered collections of a given size taken from a set.
    </p>

    <p>
      A <index><main>combination</main></index> <em><m>k</m>-combination from an <m>n</m>-set</em> is an
      unordered selection, without repetitions, of <m>k</m> things out of <m>n</m>.
      This is the exact same thing as a subset of size <m>k</m> of a set of size
      <m>n</m>, and the number of such things is denoted by several different
      notations <mdash /> <m>C(n,k)</m>, <m>nCk</m> and <m>\displaystyle\binom{n}{k}</m> among
      them<fn>Watch out for the <m>\binom{n}{k}</m> notation, it is easy 
      to confuse it with the fraction <m>\left(\frac{n}{k}\right)</m>.  They are
      not the same <mdash /> the fraction bar is <em>supposed</em> to be missing
      in <m>\binom{n}{k}</m>.</fn>. We can come
      up with a formula for <m>C(n,k)</m> by a slightly roundabout argument.
      Suppose we think of counting the <m>k</m>-permutations of <m>n</m> things using the
      multiplication rule in a different way then we have previously. We'll
      build a <m>k</m>-permutation in two stages. First we'll choose <m>k</m> symbols
      to put into our permutation <mdash /> which can be done in <m>C(n,k)</m> ways. And
      second, we'll put those <m>k</m> symbols into a particular order <mdash /> which
      can be accomplished in <m>k!</m> ways. Thus <m>P(n,k) = C(n,k) \cdot k!</m>.
      Since we already know that <m>P(n,k) = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}</m>, we can
      substitute and solve to obtain
      <me>
        C(n,k) = \frac{n!}{k! \cdot (n-k)!}.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      It is possible to partition many counting problems into 4 <q>types</q>
      based on the answers to two questions:
    </p>

    <p>
      Is order important in the configurations being counted?
    </p>

    <p>
      Are we allowed to have repeated elements in a configuration?
    </p>

    <p>
      Suppose that we are in the general situation of selecting <m>k</m> things
      out of a set of size <m>n</m>. It should be possible to write formulas
      involving <m>n</m> and <m>k</m> in the four cells of the following table.

      <em>Ordered with repetition</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      Selecting a <index><main>PIN</main></index>PIN number<fn>The phrase <q>PIN number</q> is 
      redundant.  The `N' in PIN stands for <q>number.</q>  Anyway, a PIN is
      a four digit (secret) number used to help ensure that automated banking
      (such as withdrawing your life's savings) is only done by an authorized
      individual.</fn> for your bank account is a good example of
      the kind of problem that is dealt with in the lower left part of the
      table. Obviously, the order in which you key-in the digits of your PIN
      is important. If one's number is 1356, it won't do to put in 6531!
      Also there is no reason that we couldn't have repeated digits in a PIN.
      (Although someone who chooses a PIN like 3333 is taking a bit of a security
      risk! A bad guy looking over your shoulder may easily discern what your
      PIN is.) A PIN is an ordered selection of 4 things out of 10, where
      repetition is allowed. There are <m>10^4</m> possible PINs. We can determine
      this by thinking of the multiplication principle <mdash /> there are 10 choices
      for the first digit of our PIN, since repetition is okay there are still
      10 choices for our second digit, then (still) 10 choices for the third
      digit as well as the fourth digit.
    </p>

    <p>
      In general, when selecting <m>k</m> things out of <m>n</m> possibilities, where order
      counts and repetition is allowed, there are <m>n^k</m> possible selections.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Ordered without repetition</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      Suppose that one wishes to come up with a password for a computer
      account. There are 52 letters (both upper and lower case) 10 numerals
      and 32 symbols and punctuation marks <mdash /> for a total of 94 different
      characters that
      may be used. Some system administrators can be very paranoid about
      passwords that might be guessable <mdash /> for instance no password that
      appears in a dictionary should ever be used on a system where security
      is a concern. Suppose that your system administrator will reject any
      password that has repeated symbols, and that passwords must have 8
      characters. How many passwords are possible?
    </p>

    <p>
      This is an instance of a counting problem where we are selecting 8 things
      out of a set of size 94 <mdash /> clearly order is important and the system
      administrator's restriction means that we may not have repeats.
      The multiplication rule tells us that there are
      <m>94\cdot 93\cdot 92\cdot 91\cdot 90\cdot 89\cdot 88\cdot 87 = 4488223369069440</m>
      different passwords. And in the general case (selecting <m>k</m> things out
      of a set of size <m>n</m>, without repetition, and with order counting)
      there will be <m>n!/(n-k)!</m> possibilities. This is the number we have
      denoted previously by <m>P(n,k)</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Unordered without repetition</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      This is also a case that we've considered previously. If we are choosing
      <m>k</m> things out of <m>n</m> and order is unimportant and there can be no
      repetitions, then what we are describing is a <m>k</m>-subset of the
      <m>n</m>-set. There are <m>C(n,k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}</m> distinct subsets.
      Here, we'll give an example that doesn't sound like we're talking
      about counting subsets of a particular size. (Although we really are!)
    </p>

    <p>
      How many different sequences of 6 strictly increasing numbers can
      we choose from <m>\{1, 2, 3, \ldots 20\}</m>?
    </p>

    <p>
      Obviously, listing all such sequences would be an arduous task.
      We might start with <m>(1,2,3,4,5,6)</m> and try to proceed in some
      orderly fashion to <m>(15,16,17,18,19,20)</m>, but unfortunately there
      are 38,760 such sequences so unless we enlist the aid of a computer
      we are unlikely to finish this job in a reasonable time. The number
      we've just given (38,760) is <m>C(20,6)</m> and so it would seem that we're
      claiming that this problem is really unordered selection without repetition
      of 6 things out of 20. Well, actually, some parts of this are clearly
      right <mdash /> we are selecting 6 things from a set of size 20, and because
      our sequences are supposed to be <em>strictly</em> increasing there will
      be no repetitions <mdash /> but, a strictly increasing sequence is clearly
      <em>ordered</em> and the formula we are using is for <em>unordered</em>
      collections.
    </p>

    <p>
      By specifying a particular ordering (strictly increasing) on the sequences
      we are counting above, we are actually removing the importance of order.
      Put another way: if order really mattered, the symbols <m>1</m> through <m>6</m>
      could be put into <m>720</m> different orders <mdash /> but we only want to count
      one of those possibilities. Put another other way: there is a one-to-one
      correspondence between a <m>6</m>-subset of <m>\{1,2,3, \ldots 20\}</m> and a
      strictly increasing sequence. Just make sure the subset is written in
      increasing order!

      What kinds of things are we counting in the lower right part of the table?
      Unordered selections of <m>k</m> things out of <m>n</m> possibilities where there may
      (or may not!) be repetitions. The game Yahtzee provides a nice example of
      this type of configuration. When we roll 5 dice, we do not do so
      one-at-a-time, rather, we roll them as a group <mdash /> the dice are
      indistinguishable so there is no way to order our set of 5 outcomes.
      In fact, it would be quite reasonable to, after one's roll, arrange the
      die in (say) increasing order. We'll repeat a bit of advice that was given
      previously: if one is free to rearrange a configuration to suit one's needs,
      that is a clue that order is <em>not</em> important in the configurations
      under consideration. Finally, are repetitions allowed? The outcomes
      in Yahtzee are 5 numbers from the set <m>\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}</m>, and while it
      is possible to have no repetitions, that is a pretty special outcome!
      In general, the same number can appear on two, or several, or even
      <em>all 5</em> of the die<fn>When this happens you are supposed 
      to jump in the air and yell <q>Yahtzee!</q></fn>.
    </p>

    <p>
      So, how many different outcomes
      are there when one rolls five dice? To answer this question it will
      be helpful to think about how we might express such an outcome.
      Since order is unimportant, we can choose to put the numbers that appear
      on the individual die in whatever order we like. We may as well place them
      in increasing order. There will be 5 numbers and each number is between 1
      and 6. We can list the outcomes systematically by starting with an all-ones
      Yahtzee:

      Whew <ellipsis /> err, I mean, Yahtzee!

    <p>
      You can describe a generic element of the above listing by saying <q>It starts
      with some number of 1's (which may be zero), then there are some 2's (again,
      it might be that there are zero 2's), then some (possibly none) 3's,
      then some 4's (or maybe not), then some
      5's (I think you probably get the idea) and finally some 6's (sorry for
      all the parenthetical remarks).</q>
    </p>

    <p>
      We could, of course, actually count the
      outcomes as listed above (there are 252) but that would be pretty dull <mdash /> and
      it wouldn't get us any closer to solving such problems in general. To
      count things like Yahtzee rolls it will turn out that we can count something
      related but much simpler <mdash /> blank-comma arrangements. For the Yahtzee
      problem we count arrangements of 5 blanks and 5 commas. That is,
      things like { \rule{.4pt}{1.2pt}\rule{9pt}{.4pt}\rule{.4pt}{1.2pt}\rule{.4pt}{1.2pt}\rule{9pt}{.4pt}\rule{.4pt}{1.2pt},\rule{.4pt}{1.2pt}\rule{9pt}{.4pt}\rule{.4pt}{1.2pt},,\rule{.4pt}{1.2pt}\rule{9pt}{.4pt}\rule{.4pt}{1.2pt},\rule{.4pt}{1.2pt}\rule{9pt}{.4pt}\rule{.4pt}{1.2pt},} and
      { \rule{.4pt}{1.2pt}\rule{9pt}{.4pt}\rule{.4pt}{1.2pt}\rule{.4pt}{1.2pt}\rule{9pt}{.4pt}\rule{.4pt}{1.2pt}\rule{.4pt}{1.2pt}\rule{9pt}{.4pt}\rule{.4pt}{1.2pt}\rule{.4pt}{1.2pt}\rule{9pt}{.4pt}\rule{.4pt}{1.2pt}\rule{.4pt}{1.2pt}\rule{9pt}{.4pt}\rule{.4pt}{1.2pt},,,,,} and
      { ,,,\rule{.4pt}{1.2pt}\rule{9pt}{.4pt}\rule{.4pt}{1.2pt}\rule{.4pt}{1.2pt}\rule{9pt}{.4pt}\rule{.4pt}{1.2pt}\rule{.4pt}{1.2pt}\rule{9pt}{.4pt}\rule{.4pt}{1.2pt}\rule{.4pt}{1.2pt}\rule{9pt}{.4pt}\rule{.4pt}{1.2pt}\rule{.4pt}{1.2pt}\rule{9pt}{.4pt}\rule{.4pt}{1.2pt},,}.
      These arrangements of blanks and commas correspond uniquely to Yahtzee
      rolls <mdash /> the commas serve to separate different numerical values
      and the blanks are where we would write-in the 5 outcomes on the die.
    </p>

    <p>
      Convince yourself that there really is a one-to-one correspondence
      between Yahtzee outcomes and arrangements of 5 blanks and 5 commas
      by doing the following

        </p>
      </statement>
    </exercise>
    <p>
      It may seem at first that this blank-comma thing is okay, but that we're
      still no closer to answering the question we started with. It may seem
      that way until you realize how easy it is to count these blank-comma
      arrangements! You see, there are 10 symbols in one of these blank-comma
      arrangements
      and if we choose positions for (say) the commas, the blanks will have to go
      into the other positions <mdash /> thus every 5-subset of <m>\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\}</m>
      gives us a blank-comma arrangement and every one of <em>them</em> gives us
      a Yahtzee outcome. That is why there are <m>C(10, 5) = 252</m> outcomes
      listed in the giant tabulation above.
    </p>

    <p>
      In general, when we are selecting <m>k</m> things from a set of size <m>n</m>
      (with repetition and without order) we will need to consider
      blank-comma arrangements having <m>k</m> blanks and <m>n-1</m> commas. As an
      aid to memory, consider that when you actually write-out the elements
      of a set it takes one fewer commas than there are elements <mdash /> for example
      <m>\{1,2,3,4\}</m> has 4 elements but we only need 3 commas to separate them.
      The general answer to our problem is either <m>C(k+n-1,k)</m> or
      <m>C(k+n-1, n-1)</m>, depending on whether you want to think about
      selecting positions for the <m>k</m> blanks or for the <m>n-1</m> commas.
      It turns out that these binomial coefficients are equal so there's
      no problem with the apparent ambiguity.
    </p>

    <p>
      So, finally, our table of counting formulas is complete. We'll produce
      it here one more time and, while we're at it, ditch the <m>C(n,k)</m> notation in
      favor of the more usual <q>binomial coefficient</q> notation <m>\binom{n}{k}</m>.
