  <title>Divisibility statements and other proofs using PMI</title>
  <p>
    There is a very famous result known as
    <index><main>Fermat's little theorem</main></index>Fermat's Little Theorem.
    This would probably be abbreviated FLT except for two things.
    In science fiction FLT means <q>faster than light travel</q> and
    there is <em>another</em> theorem due to Fermat that goes by
    the initials FLT: <index><main>Fermat's last theorem</main></index>Fermat's Last Theorem.
    Fermat's last theorem states that equations of the form <m>a^n+b^n=c^n</m>,
    where <m>n</m> is a positive natural number,
    only have integer solutions that are trivial (like <m>0^3+1^3=1^3</m>) when <m>n</m>
    is greater than 2. When <m>n</m> is 1, there are lots of integer solutions.
    When <m>n</m> is 2, there are still plenty of integer solutions <mdash /> these are the
    so-called Pythagorean triples, for example 3,4 <ampersand /> 5 or 5,12 <ampersand /> 13.
    It is somewhat unfair that this statement is known as Fermat's last <em>theorem</em> since he didn't prove it (or at least we can't be sure that he proved it).
    Five years after his death, Fermat's son published a translated<fn>The
    translation from Greek into Latin was done by Claude Bachet.</fn> version of
    Diophantus's <em>Arithmetica</em> containing his father's notations. One of
    those notations <mdash /> near the place where Diophantus was discussing the
    equation <m>x^2+y^2=z^2</m> and its solution in whole numbers <mdash /> was the statement
    of what is now known as Fermat's last theorem as well as the following claim:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
  Cuius rei demonstrationem mirabilem sane detexi hanc marginis exiguitas non caperet.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    In English:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
  I have discovered a truly remarkable proof of this that the margin of this page is too small to contain.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Between 1670 and 1994 a lot of famous mathematicians worked on FLT but
    never found the <q>demonstrationem mirabilem.</q> Finally in 1994, Andrew Wiles
    of Princeton announced a proof of FLT, but in Wiles's own words, his is <q>a twentieth century proof</q> it can't be the proof Fermat had in mind.
  </p>

  <p>
    These days most people believe that Fermat was mistaken. Probably he thought
    a proof technique that works for small values of <m>n</m> could be generalized.
    It remains a tantalizing question, can a proof of FLT using only methods
    available in the 17th century be accomplished?
  </p>

  <p>
    Part of the reason that so many people spent so much effort on FLT
    over the centuries is that Fermat had an excellent record as regards
    being correct about his theorems and proofs. The result known as Fermat's
    little theorem is an example of a theorem and proof that Fermat got
    right. It is probably known as his <q>little</q> theorem because its
    statement is very short, but it is actually a fairly deep result.
  </p>

  <theorem>
    <title>Fermat's Little Theorem</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        For every prime number <m>p</m>, and for all integers <m>x</m>, the <m>p</m>-th
        power of <m>x</m> and <m>x</m> itself are congruent mod <m>p</m>. Symbolically:
        <me>
          x^p \equiv x \pmod{p}
        </me>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <p>
    A slight restatement of Fermat's little theorem is that <m>p</m> is
    always a divisor of <m>x^p-x</m> (assuming <m>p</m> is a prime and <m>x</m> is an integer).
    Math professors enjoy using their knowledge of Fermat's little theorem
    to cook up divisibility results that can be proved using mathematical
    induction. For example, consider the following:
    <me>
      \forall n \in \Naturals,  3 \divides (n^3 + 2n + 6).
    </me>
  </p>

  <p>
    This is really just the <m>p=3</m> case of Fermat's little theorem
    with a little camouflage added: <m>n^3 + 2n + 6 = (n^3-n)+3(n+2)</m>.
    But let's have a look at proving this statement using PMI.
  </p>

  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        <m>\forall n \in \Naturals,  3 \divides (n^3 + 2n + 6)</m>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <proof>
    <p>
      (By mathematical induction)
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Basis:</em> Clearly <m>3 \divides 6</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Inductive step:</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      (We need to show that <m>3 \divides (k^3 + 2k + 6) \; \implies \; 3 \divides ((k+1)^3 + 2(k+1) + 6</m>.)
    </p>

    <p>
      Consider the quantity <m>(k+1)^3 + 2(k+1) + 6</m>.
      <md>
        <mrow>(k+1)^3 + 2(k+1) + 6</mrow>
        <mrow>= (k^3 + 3k^2 + 3k + 1) + (2k + 2) + 6</mrow>
        <mrow>= (k^3 + 2k + 6) + 3k^2 + 3k + 3</mrow>
        <mrow>= (k^3 + 2k + 6) + 3(k^2 + k + 1).</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      By the inductive hypothesis, 3 is a divisor of <m>k^3 + 2k + 6</m> so there
      is an integer <m>m</m> such that <m>k^3 + 2k + 6 = 3m</m>.
      Thus,
      <md>
        <mrow>(k+1)^3 + 2(k+1) + 6</mrow>
        <mrow>= 3m + 3(k^2 + k + 1)</mrow>
        <mrow>= 3(m + k^2 + k + 1).</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      This equation shows that 3 is a divisor of <m>(k+1)^3 + 2(k+1) + 6</m>, which
      is the desired conclusion.
    </p>
  </proof>

  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Devise an inductive proof of the statement, <m>\forall n \in \Naturals, 5 \divides x^5+4x-10</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </exercise>
  <p>
    There is one other subtle trick for devising statements to be
    proved by PMI that you should know about. An example should
    suffice to make it clear. Notice that <m>7</m> is equivalent to <m>1 \pmod{6}</m>,
    it follows that any power of <m>7</m> is also <m>1 \pmod{6}</m>. So, if we subtract
    <m>1</m> from some power of 7 we will have a number that is divisible by <m>6</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The proof (by PMI) of a statement like this requires another subtle little
    trick. Somewhere along the way in the proof you'll need the identity <m>7=6+1</m>.
  </p>

  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <me>
        \forall n \in \Naturals, \; 6 \divides 7^n-1
      </me>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <proof>
    <p>
      (By PMI)
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Basis:</em> Note that <m>7^0-1</m> is <m>0</m> and also that <m>6 \divides 0</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Inductive step:</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      (We need to show that if <m>6 \divides 7^k-1</m> then <m>6 \divides 7^{k+1}-1</m>.)
    </p>

    <p>
      Consider the quantity <m>7^{k+1}-1</m>.
      <md>
        <mrow>7^{k+1}-1 = 7 \cdot 7^k -1</mrow>
        <mrow>= (6 + 1) \cdot 7^k - 1</mrow>
        <mrow>= 6 \cdot 7^k + 1 \cdot 7^k - 1</mrow>
        <mrow>= 6(7^k) + (7^k - 1)</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>

    <p>
      By the inductive hypothesis, <m>6 \divides 7^k - 1</m> so there is
      an integer <m>m</m> such that <m>7^k - 1 = 6m</m>. It follows that
      <me>
        7^{k+1}-1 = 6(7^k) + 6m.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      So, clearly, <m>6</m> is a divisor of <m>7^{k+1}-1</m>.
    </p>
  </proof>

  <p>
    Mathematical induction
    can often be used to prove inequalities. There are quite a few examples
    of families of statements where there is an inequality for every natural
    number. Often such statements seem to be <em>obviously</em> true and yet
    devising a proof can be illusive. If such is the case, try using PMI.
    One hint: it is fairly typical that the inductive step in a PMI proof
    of an inequality will involve reasoning that isn't particularly sharp.
    Just remember that if you have an inequality and you make the big
    side even bigger, the resulting statement is certainly still true!

    As the table illustrates, for small values of <m>n</m>, <m>2^n > n!</m>. But from <m>n=4</m>
    onward the inequality is reversed.

    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <proof>
    <p>
      (By mathematical induction)
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Basis:</em> When <m>n=4</m> we have <m>2^4 \lt  4!</m>, which is certainly
      true (<m>16 \lt  24</m>).
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Inductive step:</em> Suppose that <m>k</m> is a natural number
      with <m>k > 4</m>, and that <m>2^k \lt  k!</m>. Multiply the left hand side of this
      inequality by <m>2</m> and the right hand side by <m>k+1</m><fn>It might be 
      smoother to justify this step by first proving the lemma that 
      <m>\forall a,b,c,d \in {\mathbb R}^+, \; a\lt b \land c\lt d \implies ac \lt  bd</m>. </fn>
      to get
      <me>
        2\cdot 2^{k} \lt  (k+1) \cdot k!.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      So
      <me>
        2^{k+1} \lt  (k+1)!.
      </me>
    </p>
  </proof>

    The observant Calculus student will certainly be aware of the fact
    that, asymptotically, exponential functions grow faster than polynomial
    functions. That is, if you have a base <m>b</m> which is greater than 1, the
    function <m>b^x</m> is eventually larger than any polynomial <m>p(x)</m>. This
    may seem a bit hard to believe if <m>b=1.001</m> and <m>p(x) = 500x^{10}</m>. The
    graph of <m>y=1.001^x</m> is practically indistinguishable from the line <m>y=1</m>
    (at first), whereas the graph of <m>y=500x^{10}</m> has already reached the
    astronomical value of five trillion (<m>5,000,000,000,000</m>) when <m>x</m> is just
    <m>10</m>. Nevertheless, the exponential will eventually outstrip the polynomial.
    We can use the methods of this section to get started on proving the fact
    mentioned above. Consider the two sequences <m>n^2</m> and <m>2^n</m>.

    If we think of a <q>race</q> between the sequences <m>n^2</m> and <m>2^n</m>, notice
    that <m>2^n</m> starts out with the lead. The two sequences are tied when
    <m>n=2</m>. Briefly, <m>n^2</m> goes into the lead but they are tied again when
    <m>n=4</m>. After that it would appear that <m>2^n</m> recaptures the lead for good.
    Of course we're making a rather broad presumption <mdash /> is it really true
    that <m>n^2</m> never catches up with <m>2^n</m> again? Well, if we're right
    then the following theorem should be provable:
  </p>

  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        For all natural numbers <m>n</m>, if <m>n \geq 4</m> then <m>n^2 \leq 2^n</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <blockquote>
  <em>Proof:</em>

   <em>Basis:</em> When <m>n=4</m> we have <m>4^2 \leq 2^4</m>, which is 
  true since both numbers are 16.

   <em>Inductive step:</em> (In the inductive step we assume
  that <m>k^2 \leq 2^k</m> and then show that <m>(k+1)^2 \leq 2^{k+1}</m>.)

  The inductive hypothesis tells us that
  <me>
    k^2 \leq 2^k.
  </me>
  If we add <m>2k+1</m> to the left-hand side of this inequality
  and <m>2^k</m> to the right-hand side we will produce the desired
  inequality.  Thus our proof will follow provided that
  we know that <m>2k+1 \leq 2^k</m>.  Indeed, it is sufficient to show
  that <m>2k+1 \leq k^2</m> since we already know (by the inductive
  hypothesis) that <m>k^2 \leq 2^k</m>.

  So the result remains in doubt unless you can complete the 
  exercise that follows\ldots

          <em>Base case:</em> (<m>x=0</m>)
        </p>

        <p>
          The base case is trivial since, when <m>x=0</m>, <m>x^3-x</m> evaluates to <m>0</m> and every natural number is a divisor of <m>0</m>.

          In the inductive step we want to show that <m>\forall k \in \Naturals, \; 3 \divides k^3 - k \; \implies \; 3 \divides (k+1)^3 - (k+1)</m>. So, let <m>k</m> be an arbitrary natural number such that <m>3 \divides k^3 - k</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Consider the quantity <m>(k+1)^3 - (k+1)</m>,

          </md>
        </p>

        <p>
          By the inductive hypothesis (and the definition of divisibility), we know that there is an integer <m>q</m> such that <m>k^3-k = 3q</m>. So, by substitution, we obtain
          <me>
            (k+1)^3 - (k+1) \; = \; 3q + 3k^2 + 3k \; = 3 \cdot (q + k^2 + k).

        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, <m>q+k^2-k</m> (being the sum of integers) is certainly an integer, so by the definition of
          divisibility, it follows that <m>(k+1)^3 - (k+1)</m> is divisible by 3.
