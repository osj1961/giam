  <title>Validity of arguments and common errors</title>
  <p>
    An argument is said to be <em>valid</em> or to have a
    <index><main>valid argument form</main></index><em>valid form</em>
    if each deduction in it can be justified with one of the rules
    of inference listed in the previous section. The <em>form</em> of
    an argument might be valid, but still the conclusion may be false
    if some of the premises are false. So to show that an argument is
    good we have to be able to do two things: show that the argument
    is <em>valid</em> (i.e. that every step can be justified) and that
    the argument is
    <index><main>soundness (of an argument)</main></index><em>sound</em>
    which means that all the premises are
    true. If you start off with a false premise, you can prove <em>anything</em>!
  </p>

  <p>
    Consider, for example the following <q>proof</q> that <m>2=1</m>.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
  Suppose that <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are two real numbers such that <m>a=b</m>.
  <tabular>
    <row>
      <cell></cell>
      <cell>by hypothesis, <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are equal, so</cell>
    </row>
    <row>
      <cell><m>a^2 = ab</m></cell>
      <cell></cell>
    </row>
    <row>
      <cell></cell>
      <cell>subtracting <m>b^2</m> from both sides</cell>
    </row>
    <row>
      <cell><m>a^2 - b^2 = ab - b^2</m></cell>
      <cell></cell>
    </row>
    <row>
      <cell></cell>
      <cell>factoring both sides</cell>
    </row>
    <row>
      <cell><m>(a+b)(a-b) = b(a-b)</m></cell>
      <cell></cell>
    </row>
    <row>
      <cell></cell>
      <cell>canceling <m>(a-b)</m> from both sides</cell>
    </row>
    <row>
      <cell><m>a+b = b</m></cell>
      <cell></cell>
    </row>
  </tabular>
  Now let <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> both have a particular value, <m>a=b=1</m>,
  and we see that <m>1+1=1</m>, i.e. <m>2=1</m>.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    This argument is not sound (thank goodness!) because one of the
    premises <mdash /> actually the bad premise appears as one of the
    justifications of a step <mdash /> is false. You can argue with
    perfect logic to achieve complete nonsense if you include
    false premises.
  </p>
  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        It is <em>not</em> true that you can always cancel the same thing from
        both sides of an equation. Under what circumstances is such cancellation
        disallowed?
      </p>
    </statement>
  </exercise>
  <p>
    So, how can you tell if an argument has a valid form? Use a truth table.
    As an example, we'll verify that the rule of inference known as
    <index><main>destructive dilemma</main></index><q>destructive dilemma</q>
    is valid using a truth table. This argument
    form contains 4 predicate variables so the truth table will have 16 rows.
    There is a column for each of the variables, the premises of the argument
    and its conclusion.

  <p>
    Now, mark the lines in which all of the premises of this argument form
    are true. You should note that <em>in every single situation in which
    all the premises are true</em> the conclusion is also true. That's what
    makes <q>destructive dilemma</q> <mdash /> and all of its friends <mdash /> a rule of
    inference. Whenever all the premises are true so is the conclusion.
    You should also notice that there are several rows in which the
    conclusion is true but some one of the premises isn't. That's
    okay too, isn't it reasonable that the conclusion of an argument
    can be true, but at the same time the particulars of the argument
    are unconvincing?
  </p>

  <p>
    As we've noted earlier, an argument by deductive reasoning can go wrong
    in only certain well-understood ways. Basically, either the form of the
    argument is invalid, or at least one of the premises is false. Avoiding
    false premises in your arguments can be trickier than it sounds <mdash /> many
    statements that sound appealing or intuitively clear are actually
    counter-factual. The other side of the coin, being sure that the
    <index><main>form (of an argument)</main></index><em>form</em>
    of your argument is valid, seems easy enough <mdash /> just be
    sure to only use the rules of inference as found in <xref ref="tab_roi">Table</xref>.
    Unfortunately most arguments that you either read or write
    will be in prose, rather than appearing as a formal list of deductions.
    When dealing with that setting <mdash /> using natural rather than formalized
    language <mdash /> making errors in form is quite common.
  </p>

  <p>
    Two invalid forms are usually singled out for criticism, the
    <index><main>converse error</main></index><em>converse error</em> and the
    <index><main>inverse error</main></index><em>inverse error</em>. In some sense
    these two apparently different ways to screw up are really the same thing.
    Just as a conditional statement and its contrapositive are known to be
    equivalent, so too are the other related statements <mdash /> the
    converse and the inverse <mdash /> equivalent. The converse error consists of
    mistaking the implication in a modus ponens form for its converse.
  </p>

  <p>
    The converse error:
  </p>
  <tabular>
    <row>
      <cell></cell>
      <cell><m>B</m></cell>
    </row>
    <row>
      <cell></cell>
      <cell><m>A \implies B</m></cell>
    </row>
    <row bottom="minor">
      <cell></cell>
      <cell></cell>
    </row>
    <row>
      <cell><m>\therefore</m></cell>
      <cell><m>A</m></cell>
    </row>
  </tabular>
  <p>
    Consider, for a moment the following argument.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
  If a rhinoceros sees something on fire, it will stomp on it. 
  A rhinoceros stomped on my duck. 
  Therefore, the rhino must have thought that my duck was on fire.
  <index><main>duck, flaming</main></index>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    It <em>is</em> true that rhinoceroses have an instinctive desire to extinguish
    fires. Also, we can well imagine that if someone made this ridiculous
    argument that their duck must actually have been crushed by a rhino. But,
    is the conclusion that the duck was on fire justified? Not really, what
    the first part of the argument asserts is that <q>(on fire) implies (rhino
    stomping)</q> but couldn't a rhino stomp on something for other reasons?
    Perhaps the rhino was just ill-tempered. Perhaps the duck was just
    horrifically unlucky.
  </p>

  <p>
    The closer the conditional is to being a biconditional, the more reasonable
    sounding is an argument exhibiting the converse error. Indeed, if the
    argument actually contains a biconditional, the <q>converse error</q> is not
    an error at all.
  </p>

  <p>
    The following is a perfectly valid argument, that (sadly) has a false premise.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
  You will get an A in your Foundations class if and only if you 
  read Dr.<nbsp />Fields' book.
  You read Dr.<nbsp />Fields' book. 
  Therefore, you will get an A in Foundations.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Suppose that we try changing the major premise of that last argument to
    something more believable.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
  If you read Dr.<nbsp />Fields' book, you will pass your Foundations class. 
  You did not read Dr.<nbsp />Fields' book. 
  Therefore, you will not pass Foundations.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    This last argument exhibits the so-called <em>inverse error</em>. It is by
    no means meant as a guarantee, but nevertheless, it seems reasonable that
    if someone reads this book they will pass a course on this material.
    The second premise is also easy to envision as true, although the
    <q>you</q> that it refers to obviously isn't <em>you</em>, because <em>you</em>
    are reading this book! But even if we accept the premises as true, the
    conclusion doesn't follow. A person might have read some other book that
    addressed the requisite material in an exemplary way.
  </p>

  <p>
    Notice that the names for these two errors are derived from the change
    that would have to be made to convert them to modus ponens. For example,
    the inverse error is depicted formally by:
  </p>
  <tabular>
    <row>
      <cell></cell>
      <cell><m>{\lnot}A</m></cell>
    </row>
    <row>
      <cell></cell>
      <cell><m>A \implies B</m></cell>
    </row>
    <row bottom="minor">
      <cell></cell>
      <cell></cell>
    </row>
    <row>
      <cell><m>\therefore</m></cell>
      <cell><m>{\lnot}B</m></cell>
    </row>
  </tabular>
  <p>
    If we replaced the conditional in this argument form by its <em>inverse</em>
    (<m>{\lnot}A \implies {\lnot}B</m>) then the revised argument would be
    modus ponens. Similarly, if we replace the conditional in an
    argument that suffers from the converse error by its converse,
    we'll have modus ponens.

          If we allow quantifiers and open sentences in an argument form we
          get a couple of new argument forms. Arguments involving existentially quantified
          premises are rare <mdash /> the new forms we are speaking of are called <q>universal modus
          ponens</q> and <q>universal modus tollens.</q> The minor premises may also be quantified
          or they may involve particular elements of the universe of discourse <mdash /> this leads
          us to distinguish argument subtypes that are termed <q>universal</q> and <q>particular.</q>
        </p>

          All fish live in water.
          The octopus lives in water.
          Therefore, the octopus is a fish.
        </p>

        <p>
          Let <m>F(x)</m> be the open sentence <q>x is a fish</q> and let <m>W(x)</m> be the open sentence <q>x lives in water.</q>
        </p>

        <p>
          Our argument has the form
        </p>
        <tabular>
          <row>

        <p>
          Clearly something is wrong <mdash /> a converse error has been made <mdash /> if everything that lived in water was necessarily a fish the argument would be OK (in fact it would then be the particular form of universal modus ponens). But that is the converse of the major premise given.

          Read the following proof that the sum of two odd numbers is even.
          Discuss the rules of inference used.
        </p>

        <proof>
        <p>
          Let <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> be odd numbers. Then <m>x=2k+1</m>
          and <m>y=2j+1</m> for some integers <m>j</m> and <m>k</m>. By algebra,
          <me>
            x+y = 2k+1 + 2j+1 = 2(k+j+1).
          </me>
        </p>

        <p>
          Note that <m>k+j+1</m> is an integer because <m>k</m> and <m>j</m> are integers.
          Hence <m>x+y</m> is even.
        </p>
        </proof>
      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p>
          The definition for <q>odd</q> only involves the oddness of a single integer, but the first line of our
          proof is a conjunction claiming that <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are both odd. It seems that two conjunctive simplifications, followed by applications of the definition, followed by a conjunctive addition have been used in order to
          go from the first sentence to the second.

        <p>
          Sometimes in constructing a proof we find it necessary to <q>weaken</q> an inequality. For example,
          we might have already deduced that <m>x \lt  y</m> but what we need in our argument is that <m>x \leq y</m>. It is
          okay to deduce <m>x \leq y</m> from <m>x \lt  y</m> because the former is just shorthand for <m>x\lt y \lor x=y</m>. What
          rule of inference are we using in order to deduce that <m>x \leq y</m> is true in this situation?
