NOTES

1) Top-level mbx file is named "index.mbx".  It should take its name from the name of the top-level .tex file, or something else that can be controlled.  In GIAM, there are 3 different top-level files (which use the same subsidiary files) to create the text, the solutions manual and a workbook.

2) Should all of the files included from the top-level file (and those included from there) start w/ 
 <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>   My text editor doesn't give them syntax highlighting without that.

3) The LaTeX code for an umlauted U -- \"{U} gets translated to &Uuml; in the mbx source.  Looks right to me, but it causes an
error when running xsltproc:

>make html
  cd html;  test ! -e images && ln -s ../images; xsltproc --stringparam html.css.extra extra.css --stringparam html.knowl.example.inline no --stringparam html.knowl.exercise.inline no --xinclude ../../../Desktop/mathbook/xsl/mathbook-html.xsl ../GIAM.mbx
  ../sec_basic.mbx:6: parser error : Entity 'Uuml' not defined
     Kronecker <mdash /> ``Die ganze Zahl schuf der liebe Gott, alles &Uuml;brige
                                                                            ^

  Changing it to &#220; seems to work.

4) Why change the file/directory structure that the author used?  My source files were organized into directories and 
granularized at the chapter level.  The generated mbx files are all in one directory and are granularized at the section level.

5) The script recognizes the starts of my Exercise sections, marking them as <exercises> but the contents of those sections are treated as ordered lists, so each exercise is marked as a <li> not as an <exercise>.  My \hint{} environment should be treated as analagous to the <hint> element of an <exercise>.

6) Text inside my \hint{} commands is getting some pre-processing (probably unrecognizable junk should just get passed through) mangling math and introducing non UTF-8 characters.

  ../sec_def.mbx:3235: parser error : Input is not proper UTF-8, indicate encoding !
  Bytes: 0xB7 0x20 0x28 0x2D
   figure out what N is by thinking about the other end of the range: (-1)2 + 31  
                                                                                 ^
7) The TeX construct \centerline{foo bar} is ignored (probably appropriately) but there is an extraneous slash introduced: "\foo bar"

8) What in LaTeX would get translated to <sidebyside>?  Many of my \minipage's are used to put a paragraph sidebyside with an image.
