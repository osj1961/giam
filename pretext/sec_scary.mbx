    It is often the case that we want to prove statements that
    assert something is true for <em>every</em> element of a set.
    For example, <q>Every number has an additive inverse.</q>
    You should note that the truth of that statement is relative,
    it depends on what is meant by <q>number.</q> If we are talking
    about natural numbers it is clearly false: 3's additive
    inverse isn't in the set under consideration. If we are
    talking about integers or any of the other sets we've considered,
    the statement is true. A statement that begins with the English
    words <q>every</q> or <q>all</q> is called <index><main>universal quantification</main></index>
    <em>universally quantified</em>.
    It is asserted that the statement holds for <em>everything</em> within
    some universe. It is probably clear that when we are making
    statements asserting that a thing has an additive inverse, we
    are not discussing human beings or animals or articles of clothing <mdash /> we are talking about objects that it is reasonable to add together:
    numbers of one sort or another. When being careful <mdash /> and we should always
    strive to be careful! <mdash /> it is important to make explicit what
    universe (known as the <index><main>universe of discourse</main></index><em>universe of discourse</em>) the objects
    we are discussing come from. Furthermore, we need to distinguish
    between statements that assert that everything in the universe of
    discourse has some property, and statements that say something
    about a few (or even just one) of the elements of our universe.
    Statements of the latter sort are called <index><main>existential quantification</main></index>
    <em>existentially quantified</em>.

    Adding to the glossary or translation lexicon we started earlier,
    there are symbols which describe both these types of quantification.
    The symbol <m>\forall</m>, an upside-down A, is used for universal
    quantification, and is usually translated as <q>for all.</q>
    The symbol <m>\exists</m>, a backwards E, is used for existential
    quantification, it's translated as <q>there is</q> or <q>there exists.</q>
    Lets have a look at a mathematically precise sentence that captures
    the meaning of the one with which we started this section.
    <me>
      \forall x \in \Integers, \; \exists y \in \Integers, \; x+y=0.
    </me>
  </p>

  <p>
    Parsing this as we have done before with an English translation in
    parallel, we get:

      <cell>For every number <m>x</m></cell>
      <cell>in the set of integers</cell>
      <cell>there is a number <m>y</m></cell>

      their sum is <m>0</m>.</cell>

        Which type of quantification do the following
        statements have?

              Every dog has his day.

          <li>
            <p>
              Some days it's just not worth getting out of bed.

          <li>
            <p>
              There's a party in <em>somebody's</em> dorm this Saturday.

    A couple of the examples in the exercise above actually have two quantifiers
    in them. When there are two or more (different) quantifiers in a sentence
    you have to be careful about keeping their order straight. The following
    two sentences contain all the same elements except that the words that
    indicate quantification have been switched. Do they have the same meaning?

  <blockquote>
  For every student in James Woods High School, there is some item of
  cafeteria food that they like to eat.

          sentence in which the quantifiers appear (<m>\forall \exists \forall \exists</m>)
          and another in which they appear (<m>\exists \forall \exists \forall</m>).
