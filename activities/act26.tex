\begin{enumerate}
\item Complete the following tables about sums of squares.

\begin{tabular}{c|c}
\vs\hs $n$ \hs & \hs $\displaystyle \sum_{j=1}^n \, j^2$ \hs \\ \hline
\vs $1$ & $1$ \\
\vs $2$ & \\

\vs $4$ & \\
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{c|c}
\vs \hs $n$ \hs & \hs $\displaystyle \frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{6}$ \hs \\ \hline

\item The base case for an inductive proof that

\[ \sum_{j=1}^n \, j^2 \; = \; \frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{6}\]

really just consists of noticing that the first rows in the two tables
above are identical.  Write the base case formally.

\vfill

\newpage

\item The inductive step in a proof that

\[ \sum_{j=1}^n \, j^2 \; = \; \frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{6}\]

involves verifying the following equality

\[ (k + 1)^2 \, + \, \frac{k(k + 1)(2k + 1)}{6} \; = \; 
\frac{(k + 1)((k + 1) + 1)(2(k + 1) + 1)}{6}
\]

or (after simplifying the right-hand side)

\[ (k + 1)^2 \, + \, \frac{k(k + 1)(2k + 1)}{6} \; = \; 
\frac{(k + 1)(k + 2)(2k + 3)}{6}
\]

\noindent Do it! (Try to take advantage of the factored form as much as
possible.)

\vfill

\newpage

\item Put the last problems together and write a complete inductive proof
of the formula for the sum of squares.

\vfill

\newpage

\item The image below illustrates that a perfect square can be decom-
posed into a sum of odd numbers. (The L-shaped things are a
visual representation for odd numbers.  Do you see why?)
\bigskip

\centerline{ \input{L-decomp.tex} }
\bigskip

Notice that the number of terms in the sum is the quantity that is
squared, so

\[ \forall n \in \Naturals, \; \sum_{i=0}^n \, 2i+1 \; = \; (n+1)^2 \]

\noindent (Since a sum that goes from $0$ to $n$ has $n + 1$ terms.)

\noindent What will we need to add to both sides of the inductive hypothesis?

\vspace{.75in}

Work out the algebraic part in the inductive step:

\[(n + 1)^2 + \underline{\hspace{.75in}} \; = \; ((n + 1) + 1)^2 \]

\item The triangular numbers are the numbers that can be expressed as
triangular arrays of points.
\bigskip

\centerline{ \input{triangular_numbers.tex} }
\bigskip

Let $T_n$ represent the $n$-th triangular number.  So $T_1 = 1$, $T_2 = 3$,
$T_3 = 6$, {\em et cetera}.

Each triangular number can be thought of as a sum, which allows
us to deduce a formula for $T_n$.  What is it?

\vfill

\item Find a formula for the sum

\[ \sum_{j=1}^n \; T_j, \]

\noindent and prove it using mathematical induction.

\vfill

\newpage

\item A {\em hexagonal number} is one that can be represented by a hexagonal
array of dots.  A formula for the hexagonal numbers is

\[ H_n \, = \, 3n^2 - 3n + 1. \]

Find a formula for the sum

\[
\sum_{j=1}^n \, H_j 
\] 

\noindent and prove it using mathematical induction.

\vfill

\newpage

\item (Exercise 5 in GIAM \S 5.2) Prove the following formula for a prod-
uct.

\[ \prod_{i=2}^n \, \left( 1 - \frac{1}{i} \right) \; = \; \frac{1}{n}  \]

\vfill

\newpage

\item Here is a formula for the sum of the first $n$ fourth powers

\[ \frac{n \cdot (n + 1) \cdot (2n + 1) \cdot (3n^2 + 3n - 1)}{30}. \]

Prove it using induction.
