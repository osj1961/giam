Give inductive proofs of the following 
\begin{enumerate}
\item A ``postage stamp problem'' is a problem that (typically) asks
us to determine what total postage values can be produced using two
sorts of stamps.  Suppose that you have $3$\cents stamps and $7$\cents 
stamps, show (using strong induction) that any postage value $12$\cents 
or higher can be achieved.  That is, 

\[ \forall n \in \Naturals, n \geq 12 \; \implies \;
\exists x,y \in \Naturals , n = 3x + 7y. \]

\item Show that any integer postage of $12$\cents or more can be made using
only $4$\cents and $5$\cents stamps.

\item The polynomial equation $x^2 = x+1$ has two solutions, 
$\alpha = \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$ and $\beta = \frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2}$.
Show that the Fibonacci number $F_n$ is less than or equal to $\alpha^{n}$
for all $n \geq 0$.
